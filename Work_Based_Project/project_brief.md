# Work-Based Project – Brief (Generic)  
*(Security First Line Manager – JARGON8)*  

## Project Title  
Enhancing Incident Response and Reporting Procedures in Security Operations  

---

## Problem Statement (Generic)  
Current incident response and reporting processes are inconsistent, leading to:  
- Delays in response times during peak hours.  
- Incomplete or inaccurate incident records.  
- Risk of non-compliance with regulatory and contractual obligations.  
- Reduced stakeholder confidence due to lack of timely updates.  

This issue affects overall operational efficiency, increases risk exposure, and could result in reputational or contractual penalties if not addressed.

## Objectives (SMART)  
- **Specific:** Standardise and improve incident response and reporting processes.  
- **Measurable:** Achieve 95% compliance with incident reporting standards within 3 months.  
- **Achievable:** Implement new reporting templates, training, and monitoring without additional staffing costs.  
- **Relevant:** Supports organisational goals of safety, compliance, and service excellence.  
- **Time-Bound:** Deliver improvements and measure outcomes within a 12-week period.

## Scope & Assumptions  
- **Scope:**  
  - Applies to all security staff and supervisors on site.  
  - Covers incident response protocols, logging procedures, and escalation processes.  
  - Includes introduction of a standardised reporting template and refresher training sessions.  

- **Assumptions:**  
  - All data will be anonymised (no client or individual names).  
  - Training resources and systems are available for implementation.  
  - No additional costs beyond existing operational budget.  
  - Project focuses on compliance and operational improvement, not disciplinary issues.

## Expected Outcomes  
- Improved response times with clear escalation routes.  
- Standardised incident logs ensuring compliance with legislation (e.g. [Data Protection Act 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted), [Health and Safety at Work Act 1974](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/contents)).  
- Greater transparency and accountability through accurate record-keeping.  
- Increased stakeholder confidence and measurable improvement in KPI performance.
