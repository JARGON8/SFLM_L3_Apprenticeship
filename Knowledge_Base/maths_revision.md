# Maths Revision for Security First Line Managers

As part of my apprenticeship, I need to apply practical maths skills to manage staffing, monitor performance, and analyse security data. The calculations themselves are straightforward, but what matters is understanding what each tool is, why it matters, and how to apply it correctly in a UK security management context. This section is both a revision guide and a reminder of how numbers support evidence-based decision making.

## Counting & Scheduling (Basic Arithmetic)

**What it is:**  
Counting and scheduling use the four basic operations of arithmetic ‚Äì addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division ‚Äì to work out how many resources are needed to cover a given requirement.  

**Why it matters in security:**  
Staffing levels are one of the biggest responsibilities of a First Line Manager. If I cannot calculate how many hours or officers are required to cover a rota, shifts may be under-resourced, causing fatigue, stress, or even breaches of contract.  

**Example:**  
- To provide **24/7 coverage** with one officer at all times:  
  24 hours √ó 7 days = **168 officer-hours per week**.  
- If each officer is contracted for 42 hours per week:  
  168 √∑ 42 = **4 officers required** (before allowing for annual leave, sickness, or training).  

üìñ **UK Guidance:**  
- [HSE ‚Äì Managing shift work](https://www.hse.gov.uk/humanfactors/ergonomics/shift-work.htm) ‚Äì explains the health and safety risks of poor scheduling and the importance of correct arithmetic when planning rosters.

## Percentages (KPIs, Incident Trends)

**What it is:**  
A percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. It is a universal way to measure change, progress, or compliance against a target.  

**Why it matters in security:**  
Percentages allow me to measure **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** such as patrol completion, incident reductions, or audit results. Clients and senior managers often expect performance data to be expressed in percentages because it is easy to understand and compare.  

**Examples:**  
- If 250 incidents occurred last year and 200 this year:  
  Reduction = (50 √∑ 250) √ó 100 = **20% decrease**.  
- If the KPI requires 95% patrol completion and my team achieved 93%:  
  (93 √∑ 95) √ó 100 = **97.9% of target achieved**.  

üìñ **UK Guidance:**  
- [BS 10800:2020 ‚Äì Provision of Security Services](https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/provision-of-security-services-code-of-practice) ‚Äì requires performance measurement and reporting, often expressed as percentages.  
- [National Occupational Standards for Security](https://www.ukstandards.org.uk/) ‚Äì outline service effectiveness measures, including percentage-based targets.

## Ratios and Averages

**What they are:**  
- A **ratio** compares two numbers, showing how one value relates to another.  
- An **average (mean)** is the sum of values divided by the number of values, showing a central or ‚Äútypical‚Äù figure.  

**Why they matter in security:**  
Ratios and averages help make comparisons fair and meaningful. They show proportionality ‚Äî important when incident numbers need to be adjusted for visitor volume or site size. Averages also make it easier to spot patterns over time.  

**Examples:**  
- **Ratio:** 10 incidents for 5,000 visitors = **1 incident per 500 visitors**.  
- **Average:** Incidents over 4 weeks = 12, 8, 10, 14 (total = 44).  
  Mean = 44 √∑ 4 = **11 incidents per week**.  

üìñ **UK Guidance:**  
- [Office for National Statistics (ONS) ‚Äì Crime and Safety Data](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice) ‚Äì reports crime figures per 1,000 people, showing how ratios are used in national statistics.

## Interpreting Charts and Forecasting

**What it is:**  
Charts (bar, line, pie) visually represent data, while forecasting uses past data to estimate future outcomes.  

**Why it matters in security:**  
Charts make data easier to explain to non-specialists such as clients or senior managers. Forecasting helps predict risks (e.g. theft spikes at Christmas) so I can plan staffing and controls in advance.  

**Examples:**  
- A **line graph** of incidents per month shows seasonal trends.  
- A **bar chart** of patrol completion by shift highlights where compliance is lowest.  
- **Simple forecasting:** If incidents average 10 per week over 8 weeks, I expect around 10 next week unless new controls change the pattern.  

üìñ **UK Guidance:**  
- [HSE ‚Äì Managing for Health and Safety (HSG65)](https://www.hse.gov.uk/managing/health-and-safety.htm) ‚Äì emphasises monitoring, reviewing data, and using trends to guide controls.  
- [National Risk Register 2023](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-risk-register-2023) ‚Äì demonstrates how the UK government uses data and forecasting to prepare for national risks.

## Reflection

By revising and applying these core maths skills I can:  
- Schedule staff effectively and safely using arithmetic.  
- Track KPIs accurately with percentages.  
- Compare risks and incidents proportionately with ratios and averages.  
- Communicate trends clearly and plan ahead using charts and forecasts.  

These are not abstract classroom skills. They are **everyday tools** that support fairness, compliance, and professionalism in UK security management. Accuracy builds trust with both my team and stakeholders, and aligns with standards such as **BS 10800** and guidance from the **HSE** and **ONS**.
