# Maths Revision for Security First Line Managers

As part of my apprenticeship, I have to apply practical maths skills to manage staffing, monitor performance, and analyse trends. The calculations are straightforward, but accuracy is essential for compliance, fairness, and effective decision-making. Below I outline the key areas of maths I revise, with examples relevant to UK security management.

## Counting & Scheduling (Basic Arithmetic)

I use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division when working out **staffing levels** and **coverage**. For example:  

- If I need **24/7 coverage** with one officer on duty at all times, I calculate:  
  24 hours Ã— 7 days = **168 officer-hours per week**.  
- If one officer works 42 contracted hours per week, I divide:  
  168 Ã· 42 = **4 officers required** for minimum coverage (not including absence cover).  

ðŸ“– **UK Guidance:**  
- [HSE â€“ Managing shift work](https://www.hse.gov.uk/humanfactors/ergonomics/shift-work.htm) â€“ importance of safe rostering and arithmetic checks to avoid fatigue.

## Percentages (KPIs, Incident Trends)

I apply percentages to measure **performance improvements** and **KPI tracking**. Examples include:  

- If 250 incidents occurred last year and 200 this year:  
  Reduction = (50 Ã· 250) Ã— 100 = **20% decrease**.  
- If a KPI requires 95% patrol completion and my team achieved 93%, then:  
  Achievement = (93 Ã· 95) Ã— 100 = **97.9% of target met**.  

ðŸ“– **UK Guidance:**  
- [BS 10800:2020 â€“ Provision of Security Services](https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/provision-of-security-services-code-of-practice) â€“ highlights monitoring, KPIs, and performance measurement.  
- [National Occupational Standards for Security](https://www.ukstandards.org.uk/) â€“ include examples of monitoring service effectiveness with percentages.

## Ratios and Averages

Ratios and averages help me **make fair comparisons** and **spot patterns**.  

- **Ratio example:** 10 incidents for every 5,000 visitors = 10:5000, simplified to **1 incident per 500 visitors**.  
- **Average example:** Over a 4-week period, incident totals of 12, 8, 10, and 14 = 44.  
  Mean = 44 Ã· 4 = **11 incidents per week**.  

Ratios are especially useful when comparing sites or time periods with different visitor numbers, ensuring fairness in reporting.  

ðŸ“– **UK Guidance:**  
- [Office for National Statistics (ONS) â€“ Crime and Safety Data](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice) â€“ often expressed per 1,000 population, a method I replicate in security reporting.

## Interpreting Charts and Forecasting

I use **bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts** to visualise trends. This helps in presentations and when explaining data to non-specialists.  

- Example: A **line graph** showing incidents per month can reveal seasonal peaks (e.g. December retail theft).  
- Example: A **bar chart** comparing patrol completion across shifts may highlight a gap at night.  

For **simple forecasting**, I project forward using past averages:  
- If incidents average 10 per week over the last 8 weeks, I anticipate around **10 incidents next week**, unless new controls are introduced.  

ðŸ“– **UK Guidance:**  
- [HSE â€“ Managing for health and safety (HSG65)](https://www.hse.gov.uk/managing/health-and-safety.htm) â€“ stresses monitoring, reviewing data, and trend analysis.  
- [National Risk Register 2023](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-risk-register-2023) â€“ an example of UK government forecasting based on historical and emerging trends.

## Reflection

These maths skills are basic but crucial. They allow me to:  
- Schedule staff fairly and safely.  
- Track KPIs with accuracy.  
- Compare risks and incidents proportionately.  
- Present clear, evidence-based reports for decision-making.  

By linking arithmetic to real-world security scenarios, I ensure my decisions are transparent, justifiable, and in line with UK standards.
