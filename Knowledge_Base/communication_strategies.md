# Communication Strategies  
*(Security First Line Manager – Jorge Ariel Santiago Gonzalez)*  

As part of my apprenticeship, I have developed and applied structured communication strategies to ensure clarity, professionalism, and effective teamwork. These strategies are critical to my role in maintaining safety, service standards, and stakeholder confidence.

## 1. Briefings, Handovers, and Logs  

- I deliver **clear and concise briefings** at the start of each shift to outline risks, contractor activities, and operational priorities.  
- During **handover**, I ensure continuity by highlighting incidents, pending tasks, and site-specific risks so the incoming team is fully aware.  
- I maintain **accurate and factual logs** that record incidents chronologically, free from personal opinion, in line with organisational and legal requirements.  
- I confirm understanding by encouraging officers to ask questions or repeat back critical instructions.  

**Why it matters:**  
- Prevents miscommunication and errors  
- Ensures accountability and transparency  
- Supports legal, compliance, and audit requirements

## 2. Handling Conflict and Difficult Conversations  

- I use **calm, courteous, and professional language** when faced with conflict.  
- I apply **de-escalation techniques** such as active listening, empathy, and assertiveness where needed.  
- In difficult staff conversations (e.g. performance feedback), I remain respectful, focus on behaviours not personalities, and agree on clear actions.  
- I record outcomes where appropriate, ensuring a balance between confidentiality and accountability.  

**Why it matters:**  
- Maintains safety and professionalism under pressure  
- Protects reputation of the security team and organisation  
- Builds trust and fairness among colleagues, tenants, and visitors

## 3. Stakeholder Updates and Expectations Management  

- I provide **professional updates** to stakeholders such as Knight Frank management, service partners, and contractors.  
- I adapt communication style depending on audience:  
  - **Formal reports and emails** for management  
  - **Concise operational updates** for contractors and partners  
  - **Friendly and approachable tone** for tenants and public enquiries  
- I manage expectations by being honest about timescales, risks, and solutions, ensuring I never over-promise.  
- I escalate significant issues promptly while keeping all relevant parties informed.  

**Why it matters:**  
- Strengthens professional relationships  
- Demonstrates integrity and transparency  
- Aligns service delivery with contractual and organisational standards
