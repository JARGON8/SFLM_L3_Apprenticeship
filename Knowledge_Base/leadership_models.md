# Leadership & People Management

As a Security First Line Manager apprentice, I recognise that my role is not only to ensure operational effectiveness but also to lead, motivate, and support the people I work with. Security teams perform best when leadership is adaptable, welfare is prioritised, and recognition is consistent. This section reflects what I have learned during my apprenticeship, aligned to UK standards and official guidance.

## Situational Leadership, Coaching, and Feedback

I apply the **Situational Leadership model (Hersey & Blanchard)**, adapting my approach depending on the competence and commitment of the individual or team:

- **Directing:** High task, low relationship â€“ used with new staff who need close guidance.  
- **Coaching:** High task, high relationship â€“ balancing guidance with encouragement when team members are developing.  
- **Supporting:** Low task, high relationship â€“ encouraging competent officers who need motivation or reassurance.  
- **Delegating:** Low task, low relationship â€“ allowing skilled and trusted staff to perform tasks independently.

Alongside this, I use **coaching techniques** (open questions, active listening, reflection) to encourage problem-solving.  

Feedback is structured to be:  
- **Timely** â€“ given close to the event.  
- **Specific** â€“ focused on behaviours, not personalities.  
- **Balanced** â€“ recognising positives as well as improvements.  
- **Constructive** â€“ with clear, practical actions.

## Motivation and Recognition in Security Teams

Through my apprenticeship I have studied motivational theories (e.g. **Maslowâ€™s Hierarchy of Needs** and **Herzbergâ€™s Two-Factor Theory**) and applied them to the workplace:

- **Basic needs:** Fair pay, safe conditions, and reliable rostering.  
- **Belonging and esteem:** Recognition in team meetings, or passing on client praise, builds morale.  
- **Growth:** Training, mentoring, and shadowing opportunities encourage staff to see security as a career.

Recognition is powerful when it is **fair, consistent, and inclusive**. It may be as simple as thanking someone personally or sharing good practice during a debrief.  

ðŸ“– **Standards & Guidance:**  
- [BS 10800:2020](https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/provision-of-security-services-code-of-practice) â€“ emphasises staff support and role clarity as part of service provision.  
- [Improving Security Culture (UK Government Guidance)](https://www.security.gov.uk/policy-and-guidance/improving-security-culture/) â€“ highlights that a positive culture relies on visible leadership and consistent reinforcement.

## Managing Welfare, Rostering, Fatigue, and Fairness

Leadership in security also means taking responsibility for welfare, rostering, and fairness. I have learned to:

- **Monitor welfare:** Checking that officers take breaks, have hydration, and are fit for duty.  
- **Roster fairly:** Balancing operational needs with staff availability and preferences where possible.  
- **Manage fatigue:** Avoiding excessive long shifts, rotating roles during duty, and raising concerns if staff are overstretched.  
- **Apply fairness:** Making consistent, transparent decisions and listening to staff concerns to build trust.  

ðŸ“– **Standards & Guidance:**  
- [BS 10800:2020](https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/provision-of-security-services-code-of-practice) â€“ details expectations for staffing levels, working arrangements, and monitoring.  
- [GovS 007: Security](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/613a195bd3bf7f05b694d647/GovS_007-_Security.pdf) â€“ emphasises accountability and clear role responsibilities.  
- [HMG Personnel Security Controls](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmg-personnel-security-controls/hmg-personnel-security-controls-html) â€“ guidance on staff integrity, vetting, and fairness in security management.

## Reflection

I have developed a clearer understanding that **effective leadership in security is about people first, process second**. While compliance, vigilance, and discipline remain essential, I can only achieve them by:

- Adapting my style to the individual and situation.  
- Motivating and recognising staff fairly.  
- Safeguarding welfare through responsible rostering and support.  

This approach reflects the professional behaviours required in the ST0330 standard: professionalism, courtesy, calmness, confidentiality, customer focus, and integrity.
