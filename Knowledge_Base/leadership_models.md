# Leadership & People Management

As a Security First Line Manager apprentice, I recognise that my role is not only to ensure operational effectiveness but also to lead, motivate, and support the people I work with. Security teams perform best when leadership is adaptable, welfare is prioritised, and recognition is consistent. Below I outline the main approaches I apply and develop through my apprenticeship.

## Situational Leadership, Coaching, and Feedback

I have learned that there is no single “best” leadership style. Through the **Situational Leadership model (Hersey & Blanchard)**, I adapt my approach depending on the competence and commitment of the individual or team:

- **Directing (high task, low relationship):** Useful with new staff who need close guidance, such as new starters learning site procedures.  
- **Coaching (high task, high relationship):** Balances guidance with encouragement; helpful when team members are developing confidence.  
- **Supporting (low task, high relationship):** Suitable when staff are competent but need motivation or reassurance, e.g. during a difficult shift.  
- **Delegating (low task, low relationship):** Appropriate when staff are skilled, experienced, and trusted to perform tasks independently.

Alongside situational leadership, I apply **coaching techniques**: asking open questions, encouraging self-reflection, and guiding officers to find their own solutions rather than always giving direct instructions.  

**Feedback** is another critical element. I practise delivering it in a way that is:  
- **Timely:** given close to the event.  
- **Specific:** focusing on behaviours, not personalities.  
- **Balanced:** recognising what went well before addressing improvements.  
- **Constructive:** suggesting clear actions or alternatives.

## Motivation and Recognition in Security Teams

I have seen first-hand that security officers work better when they feel valued. During my apprenticeship, I have studied motivational theories (e.g. **Maslow’s hierarchy of needs** and **Herzberg’s two-factor theory**) and applied them to real workplace situations:

- **Basic needs:** Fair pay, safe working conditions, and reliable rostering are essential.  
- **Belonging and esteem:** Recognition in team meetings or direct praise helps build pride and morale.  
- **Growth:** Offering development opportunities (e.g. training, mentoring, shadowing senior officers) motivates staff to see security as a career rather than just a job.

Recognition does not always need to be formal. A genuine “thank you,” passing positive feedback from a client, or highlighting good practice in a debrief can be very powerful. I also make sure that recognition is **fair and inclusive** across the team to avoid perceptions of favouritism.

## Managing Welfare, Rostering, Fatigue, and Fairness

Security work often involves **long shifts, night work, and public interaction**, which can affect welfare and performance. As a developing leader, I take the following responsibilities seriously:

- **Welfare:** I monitor team wellbeing during shifts, ensuring officers take breaks and raising concerns if someone is unfit for duty. I am also learning to spot signs of stress or fatigue and to encourage use of welfare support services if available.  
- **Rostering:** Fair rostering is essential to maintain morale. I aim to balance operational needs with individual circumstances, ensuring shifts are distributed fairly and preferences are considered where possible.  
- **Fatigue management:** I have learned about the risks of long working hours, especially in 12-hour patterns. I promote safe practices such as ensuring adequate rest, rotating roles during shifts, and raising concerns if excessive hours are impacting safety.  
- **Fairness:** I apply policies consistently, communicate decisions clearly, and listen to staff concerns. By treating colleagues with respect and fairness, I build trust and credibility as a leader.

## Reflection

Through this apprenticeship, I have developed a clearer understanding that **effective leadership in security is about people first, process second**. While I must ensure compliance, vigilance, and discipline, I can only achieve this by leading in a way that adapts to different situations, motivates my team, and safeguards their welfare. This approach directly supports the behaviours required in the ST0330 standard: professionalism, courtesy, calmness, confidentiality, customer focus, and integrity.
