# Laws & Regulations (Security Officers + Cybersecurity)

I use this file as my quick-reference guide to the UK laws, regulations, and formal guidance that affect my day-to-day work as a security officer and my broader responsibilities around information security and privacy. It helps me evidence legal compliance across the ST0330 standard while keeping all examples anonymised and site-neutral.

> Key themes throughout: **privacy**, **lawful authority**, **proportionality**, **record-keeping**, and **accountability**.

---

## 1) Core Regulatory Framework (Privacy & Data)

- **UK GDPR** and the **Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018)**  
  The UK GDPR sits alongside an amended DPA 2018. Together they set principles, rights, and obligations for handling personal data (lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity/confidentiality, and accountability). I apply these to incident reports, access logs, body-worn video, and CCTV footage. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

- **Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 (PoFA) – Surveillance Camera Code of Practice**  
  The updated Code (in force 12 Jan 2022) guides appropriate, effective, and proportionate use of surveillance camera systems. While certain “relevant authorities” must have regard to the Code, private operators are strongly encouraged to adopt it. I use it to shape signage, DPIAs, retention, access control and disclosure processes for imagery. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- **ICO CCTV & Video Surveillance Guidance**  
  Practical, privacy-by-design advice for CCTV/body-worn video, covering necessity, proportionality, signage, subject rights, retention and disclosures. I reference this when drafting any local procedure that touches personal data captured by cameras. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 2) Private Security Industry: Licensing, Conduct, Powers

- **Private Security Industry Act 2001 (PSIA)**  
  Establishes the Security Industry Authority (SIA) and the licensing regime. I must only undertake licensable activities when appropriately licensed and follow licence conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

- **SIA Licence Conditions & Role Summaries**  
  I comply with SIA licence conditions (display, notifications, criminality, training) and use official summaries to keep my role boundaries clear (e.g., CCTV, door supervision, public space surveillance). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

- **Use of Force & Citizen’s Arrest (England & Wales)**  
  - **Criminal Law Act 1967 s.3** – reasonable force in preventing crime or effecting lawful arrest.  
  - **PACE 1984 s.24A** – “any person” power of arrest for indictable offences (with strict necessity tests).  
  I always prioritise communication and de-escalation and record rationale, necessity, and proportionality after any use of force.

- **Public Order / Harassment / Trespass (selected)**  
  - **Public Order Act 1986 (as amended)** – managing disorderly conduct, threats, and assemblies.  
  - **Protection from Harassment Act 1997** – patterns of harassment/stalking.  
  - **Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994** – aggravated trespass.  
  These inform my incident assessment and liaison with police.

- **Equality & Human Rights**  
  - **Equality Act 2010** – prohibits discrimination; influences searches, ejections, and service delivery.  
  - **Human Rights Act 1998 (Article 8: Privacy)** – I balance security interventions with respect for private life.

## 3) Safety, Fire, and Premises Compliance

- **Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974** and **Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999**  
  Duty to ensure the health and safety of employees and others; risk assessments, training, safe systems of work.

- **Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) 2013**  
  Triggers for reporting certain incidents.

- **Fire Safety**  
  - **Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005** (England & Wales)  
  - **Fire Safety Act 2021** and **Fire Safety (England) Regulations 2022** (where applicable)  
  I follow local fire strategy, drills, evacuation roles, PEEPs, and ensure logs are complete and accurate.

---

## 4) Counter-Terrorism & Crowded Places

- **Terrorism Act 2000** and **Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015**  
  Inform vigilance, reporting of suspicious activity, and cooperation with police/CT units.

- **ACT Awareness (NaCTSO)**  
  I maintain current awareness via ACT e-learning and integrate “See, Check and Notify” into daily operations. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

## 5) Cybersecurity & Digital Operations

- **Computer Misuse Act 1990 (CMA)**  
  Main UK law criminalising unauthorised access, unauthorised acts with intent to impair, supplying/obtaining articles for use in CMA offences. Essential for distinguishing legitimate testing/administration from unlawful access. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

- **Network & Information Systems Regulations 2018 (NIS)**  
  Cyber resilience duties for Operators of Essential Services (OES) and relevant Digital Service Providers (DSPs): appropriate and proportionate security measures, and incident reporting. Even when my organisation isn’t an OES/DSP, I use NIS as a benchmark for good practice and supplier assurance. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

- **Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure (PSTI) Act 2022** *(IoT security — awareness for asset purchasing/assurance)*.

- **Investigatory Powers Act 2016 (IPA)** *(awareness)*  
  Regulates lawful interception/retention by public authorities. I ensure any internal actions avoid straying into regulated activities; when in doubt, I escalate to legal/IT governance.

- **Communications Act 2003** *(misuse of networks; awareness for incident handling)*.

## 6) Information Handling: CCTV, Body-Worn Video, Reports

- **CCTV/Video**  
  I ensure: clear signage; documented purposes; role-based access; short, justified retention; secure storage; audited disclosure procedures; and DPIAs where risk is high. (UK GDPR/DPA; PoFA Surveillance Camera Code; ICO CCTV guidance). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

- **Reports & Logs**  
  I write fact-based, objective entries; minimise personal data; avoid opinions; store and share securely; and respect data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure where applicable under law).

- **Disclosures**  
  I verify lawful basis and authority before releasing any data (incl. footage) to third parties or law enforcement; I document what, why, who, and when.

---

## 7) Standards, Codes, and Good Practice (Non-statutory but Expected)

- **British Standards frequently used in security**  
  - **BS 10800** (organisational framework for security services)  
  - **BS 7858** (screening of individuals)  
  - **BS 7499** (static site guarding and mobile patrol services)  
  - **BS 7958** (CCTV management and operation in public spaces)  
  These shape contracts, procedures, training, and audits.

- **NCSC Guidance**  
  I follow NCSC guidance for risk management, incident response, and secure configuration, applying it proportionately even when my environment isn’t formally in scope for NIS. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## 8) Practical Privacy Checklist (what I actually do)

1. **Minimise data**: collect the least personal data needed for the task.  
2. **Protect**: encrypt/store securely; restrict access; maintain audit trails.  
3. **Justify**: record lawful basis and purpose (signage for CCTV, retention schedule, disclosure logs).  
4. **Retain & delete**: follow documented retention periods and dispose securely.  
5. **Respond to rights**: know the route for subject access requests and objections.  
6. **Train & brief**: keep privacy in toolbox talks; refresh ACT/CCTV/DP awareness.  
7. **Review**: test procedures; conduct DPIAs for new cameras/processes; correct issues quickly.

## 9) Mapping to ST0330 (examples)

- **Area 1 (Health & Safety)** – H&S law in risk assessments, drills, and safe systems of work.  
- **Area 3 (Security Risk Management)** – legal risk, privacy risk, and control selection (UK GDPR, PoFA Code). :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- **Area 7 (Compliance Management)** – SIA licensing, data protection, surveillance compliance checks. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- **Area 8 (Communication)** – lawful, professional reports; secure information sharing; privacy-first language (ICO guidance). :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- **Area 10 (Operational Management)** – embed standards (BS series), test controls, audit evidence.  
- **Observation/Presentation/Interview** – explain how I apply law, justify decisions, and demonstrate accountability.

## 10) Notable Enforcement Illustrations (learning value)

- **UK GDPR fines and enforcement** underline the real-world consequences of weak security and privacy controls; I use public cases to calibrate risk and management attention. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

---

## 11) Always Keep in Mind

- **Law changes**: keep an eye on updates to surveillance, data protection, public order, and cyber laws (e.g., consultations on the **Computer Misuse Act**) and refresh training accordingly. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
- **Proportionality**: every intervention (physical or digital) must be necessary and proportionate.  
- **Documentation**: if it isn’t written down, it didn’t happen — accurate, secure records are essential.
