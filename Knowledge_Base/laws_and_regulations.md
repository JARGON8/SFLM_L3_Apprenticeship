# UK Legal & Regulatory Framework for Security and Privacy

I use this file as my quick-reference guide to the UK laws, regulations, and formal guidance that affect my day-to-day work as a security officer and my broader responsibilities around information security and privacy. It helps me evidence legal compliance across the ST0330 standard while keeping all examples anonymised and site-neutral.

> Key themes throughout: **privacy**, **lawful authority**, **proportionality**, **record-keeping**, and **accountability**.

## 1) Core Regulatory Framework (Privacy & Data)

- **[UK GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/) & [Data Protection Act 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted)**  
  Together they set principles, rights, and obligations for handling personal data. I apply these to incident reports, access logs, body-worn video, and CCTV footage.

- **[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 – Surveillance Camera Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surveillance-camera-code-of-practice)**  
  The updated Code (2022) guides appropriate, effective, and proportionate use of surveillance camera systems. I use it to shape signage, retention, and disclosure processes for imagery.

- **[ICO CCTV & Video Surveillance Guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-data-protection-themes/video-surveillance-cctv/)**  
  Practical advice for CCTV and body-worn video: necessity, proportionality, signage, subject rights, retention and disclosures.

## 10) Key Principle to Remember

Every intervention, whether physical or digital, must be **lawful, necessary, and proportionate**.  
If it isn’t written down, it didn’t happen — accurate and secure records are essential.
