# Risk Management Tools

As part of my Level 3 Security First Line Management apprenticeship, I use a range of tools to identify, assess, and control risks in the workplace. These tools help me think systematically, apply professional judgement, and ensure that security controls are both proportionate and compliant with UK standards and guidance.

## Risk Matrices (Likelihood √ó Impact)

I regularly apply **risk matrices** to prioritise threats by considering:  
- **Likelihood:** How probable is it that the event will occur?  
- **Impact:** What would the consequences be if it did?  

By plotting risks on a matrix (e.g. low/medium/high), I can decide which threats require immediate action, which need monitoring, and which are tolerable.  

üìñ **Standards & Guidance:**  
- [HSE ‚Äì Risk Assessment Guidance](https://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/controlling-risks.htm) ‚Äì official UK advice on risk evaluation and control.  
- [ISO 31000:2018 ‚Äì Risk Management (BSI publication)](https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/risk-management-guidelines-iso-31000-2018) ‚Äì international standard widely used in UK organisations for structured risk management.

## PESTLE and SWOT (Context Scanning)

I use **PESTLE analysis** (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental) to scan the external context that may influence risks, such as:  
- **Political:** Counter-terrorism strategies or government policy changes.  
- **Economic:** Budget pressures affecting staffing or resourcing.  
- **Social:** Public attitudes towards security presence.  
- **Technological:** Emerging surveillance systems or cyber threats.  
- **Legal:** Changes in data protection, H&S, or licensing law.  
- **Environmental:** Weather or climate risks to safety and security.  

I also use **SWOT analysis** (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) to evaluate the position of a team or organisation.  

üìñ **Standards & Guidance:**  
- [GovS 007: Security (UK Government Functional Standard)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/613a195bd3bf7f05b694d647/GovS_007-_Security.pdf) ‚Äì highlights the importance of scanning the environment when managing security risks.  
- [National Security Risk Assessment (Cabinet Office overview)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-security-risk-assessment-nsra) ‚Äì shows how the UK government uses structured scanning to inform national risk priorities.

## Threat, Vulnerability, Risk ‚Äì Distinctions and Examples

I apply the following distinctions:  
- **Threat:** A potential cause of harm (e.g. unauthorised entry, theft, cyber attack).  
- **Vulnerability:** A weakness that may be exploited (e.g. unlocked doors, untrained staff, unpatched software).  
- **Risk:** The combination of threat and vulnerability, weighted by likelihood and impact.  

For example, a CCTV blind spot (vulnerability) combined with high-value assets (threat) creates a significant **risk** of theft.  

üìñ **Standards & Guidance:**  
- [National Risk Register 2023](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-risk-register-2023) ‚Äì outlines threats and vulnerabilities that government considers most relevant to the UK.  
- [NCSC Cyber Threat Guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/guidance-category/threats) ‚Äì examples of digital threats and vulnerabilities in the UK context.

## Control Selection and Layered Security

I have learned to apply the principle of **layered security** (also known as ‚Äúdefence in depth‚Äù) when selecting controls. Controls should be proportionate, cost-effective, and matched to the level of risk. The main layers are:

1. **Deterrence:** Visible patrols, CCTV signage, lighting, secure fencing.  
2. **Detection:** Alarms, access control logs, surveillance monitoring.  
3. **Delay:** Barriers, locks, turnstiles, bollards, security doors.  
4. **Response:** Security officers, police liaison, incident escalation.  

üìñ **Standards & Guidance:**  
- [BS 10800:2020 ‚Äì Provision of Security Services, Code of Practice](https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/provision-of-security-services-code-of-practice) ‚Äì guidance on selecting and managing layered security controls.  
- [CPNI ‚Äì Physical Security Guidance](https://www.cpni.gov.uk/physical-security) ‚Äì official Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure advice on barriers, access controls, and layered defence.  
- [NCSC ‚Äì Defence in Depth](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps/defence-in-depth) ‚Äì cyber equivalent of layered security, focusing on detection, delay, and response in digital systems.

## Reflection

By combining **risk matrices** with **context scanning tools** (PESTLE, SWOT), and by distinguishing between **threats, vulnerabilities, and risks**, I can make informed decisions about which controls are most effective. The principle of **layered security** ensures resilience, as if one measure fails, others are in place to deter, detect, delay, or respond.  

This structured approach aligns with UK standards such as **BS 10800**, and government guidance from **HSE**, **CPNI**, and the **NCSC**, giving credibility to my evidence and ensuring my work as a First Line Manager is both professional and legally sound.
