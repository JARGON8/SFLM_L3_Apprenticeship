# Contributing & Hygiene

- Use British grammar and spelling.
- Keep all evidence **generic** (no site, client, or personal data).
- Commit messages: reference the area, e.g. `Area 3: add risk assessment exercise`.
- Use branches for larger tasks (e.g. the work-based project).
- Store certificates in `Portfolio/training_certificates/` (obscure personal data if included).
- PDFs and images are fine, but ensure they are redacted and suitable for public viewing.
