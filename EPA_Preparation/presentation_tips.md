# Apprentice Presentation – Tips  
*(Security First Line Manager – Jorge Ariel Santiago Gonzalez)*  

This guidance supports the presentation element of my **Level 3 Security First Line Manager apprenticeship**. It draws on the required areas of knowledge, skills, and behaviours, particularly:  

- **Area 3 – Security Risk & Threat Awareness**  
- **Area 6 – Compliance & Governance**  
- **Area 7 – Leadership & Teamwork**  
- **Area 10 – Continuous Professional Development (CPD)**

## 1. Narrative Structure  

Use a **simple, logical flow**:  

1. **Context** – Briefly explain the scenario/site situation without naming specific locations, clients, or individuals.  
   - Example: *“A high-footfall corporate site with mixed tenants and public access points.”*  

2. **Risk/Compliance Findings** – Identify challenges in line with **Area 3 (risk awareness)** and **Area 6 (compliance)**.  
   - Security threats (unauthorised access, tailgating, theft)  
   - Health & safety hazards (blocked fire exits, contractor practices)  
   - Compliance gaps (GDPR, SOP adherence, licence obligations)  

3. **Improvement Plan** – Outline leadership actions in line with **Area 7 (teamwork/leadership)**.  
   - Staff briefing/debriefing methods  
   - Training or toolbox talks delivered  
   - Adjustments to deployment of officers or use of technology  
   - Communication improvements with stakeholders  

4. **Operational Results** – Conclude with outcomes that also link to **Area 10 (CPD)**.  
   - Reduced incidents or risks  
   - Positive stakeholder/tenant feedback  
   - Improved KPI performance  
   - Personal learning applied to future practice

## 2. Keep Examples Anonymised and Site-Neutral  

- **Do not** name specific buildings, tenants, or incidents in presentations.  
- Use generic, professional phrasing: *“a high-profile office site”*, *“a public realm area”*.  
- This aligns with **confidentiality and integrity behaviours**, required in all apprenticeship evidence.

## 3. Rehearse and Manage Timing  

- Practise the full presentation to stay within the expected timeframe (usually **10–15 minutes**).  
- Rehearse transitions between context → risk → improvements → outcomes.  
- Time yourself:  
  - ~2 minutes: Context  
  - ~4 minutes: Risks & compliance  
  - ~4 minutes: Leadership actions  
  - ~2–3 minutes: Results & CPD

## 4. Anticipate Clarifying Questions  

Prepare for questions linked to **grading criteria**:  

- **Risk & Compliance (Areas 3 & 6)**  
  - How did you identify and assess the risks?  
  - Which compliance frameworks or legislation applied (e.g. HSE, SIA licensing, GDPR)?  

- **Leadership & Teamwork (Area 7)**  
  - How did you engage and motivate your team?  
  - How did you handle conflict or performance issues?  

- **CPD (Area 10)**  
  - What did you learn from this scenario?  
  - How will you apply the learning in future?  
  - Which development activities supported your improvement (mentoring, toolbox talks, online modules)?

## 5. Presentation Style  

- Keep slides/text **minimal** – bullet points, diagrams, or flowcharts work best.  
- Use **professional, calm delivery** – reflect core behaviours (courteous, ethical, integrity-driven).  
- Ensure examples **demonstrate competence**, not just describe tasks.  
- Speak from experience, not memory – practice reflection: *what worked, what changed, what I learned*.

## ✅ Summary  

My presentation will:  

- Follow a clear narrative (context → risk/compliance → leadership response → results).  
- Use anonymised, site-neutral examples to protect confidentiality.  
- Be rehearsed to time, with room for questions.  
- Link explicitly to apprenticeship areas **3, 6, 7, and 10**.  
- Showcase not just what I did, but how it demonstrates **security professionalism, leadership, and personal development**.
