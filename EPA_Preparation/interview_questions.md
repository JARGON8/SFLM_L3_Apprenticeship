Apprenticeship Reflection – Core Areas
Area 1: Health & Safety
How do you assess and control risks in your area of responsibility?
In my role, I assess and control risks by conducting regular dynamic risk assessments during patrols and formal reviews when planning security operations. For example, I look at hazards such as blocked fire exits, unsafe contractor practices, or suspicious behaviour in public areas. I apply the HSE’s five-step risk assessment model:
Identify hazards
Decide who may be harmed and how
Evaluate risks and implement controls
Record findings and communicate
Review and update as needed
 HSE – Risk Assessment
I then control risks by enforcing site safety policies, escalating serious hazards to management, and briefing my team on required actions. This proactive approach ensures compliance with legislation and keeps the site safe for staff, tenants, and visitors.
Area 2: Customer & Stakeholders
How do you identify and meet stakeholder needs?
I identify stakeholder needs through direct communication, feedback, and observation. At The Square, this includes:
Engaging with tenants and contractors during daily operations
Attending meetings with Knight Frank and CIS Security management
Reviewing service level agreements (SLAs) and contract requirements
Once I understand needs, I adapt my approach. For example, some stakeholders prioritise safety and rapid response, while others focus on customer service and professionalism. By tailoring my team’s actions, I ensure expectations are met and trust is built.
Area 4: Staff Management & Development
How do you manage performance and support development?
I manage performance by setting clear standards and regularly monitoring staff through:
Observation on shift – checking punctuality, professionalism, and adherence to SOPs
Feedback and 1-to-1 conversations – constructive, supportive, and solution-focused
Incident debriefs – reviewing strengths and areas for improvement
To support development, I encourage officers to engage in toolbox talks, online learning modules, and mentoring sessions. I also share my apprenticeship learning with the team, which helps raise knowledge collectively.
Area 5: Contract Performance
How do you monitor KPIs and take action?
I monitor KPIs by checking incident reports, patrol logs, access control records, and customer feedback against agreed service standards. For example, if patrol frequency is below target, I investigate staffing levels, reallocate duties, or escalate resource issues to management.
Regular monitoring allows me to spot trends, such as repeated false alarms or delayed contractor escorts, and take corrective action to ensure compliance with KPIs and SLAs.
Area 8: Communication
Give an example of adapting your communication to different audiences.
When briefing my team, I use clear, concise, and directive communication over the radio or face-to-face, ensuring there is no ambiguity. However, when speaking to Knight Frank management, I adopt a professional, formal style, often supported with written reports and data.
In contrast, when assisting members of the public, I use a friendly, approachable tone, focusing on reassurance and customer service. This ability to adapt ensures I remain effective across all audiences.
Area 9: CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)
How do you support sustainability and community initiatives?
I support CSR initiatives by promoting sustainable practices on site. This includes:
Encouraging recycling and correct waste disposal
Reducing energy usage in areas under security’s control (lights, equipment)
Supporting community safety initiatives, such as Project Servator or counter-terror awareness campaigns
These actions contribute to Knight Frank’s wider ESG and sustainability objectives while strengthening the security team’s reputation.
Area 11: SFLM Responsibilities
How does your role impact others and the wider security environment?
As a Security First Line Manager apprentice, my role directly impacts my team by:
Providing clear direction and leadership
Supporting staff welfare and professional growth
Ensuring standards are upheld consistently
My actions also influence stakeholders, contractors, and visitors by creating a safe, secure, and welcoming environment. On a wider scale, my role contributes to the professional image of security officers in the corporate sector, showing that security is not just enforcement but also customer service and risk management.
Area 12: Resource Management
How do you plan and deploy people and equipment effectively?
I plan resources by reviewing footfall patterns, contractor schedules, and site priorities. For example, during peak hours at The Square, I ensure more staff are deployed at entrances and public realm areas, while quieter periods allow for patrols and training.
I also ensure that equipment such as radios, CCTV, access control systems, and PPE are available and functioning. By aligning people and resources to operational needs, I ensure efficiency, compliance, and high service standards.
