# Apprenticeship Reflection – Core Areas  
*(Security First Line Manager – Jorge Ariel Santiago Gonzalez)*

> This repository contains my concise, first-person reflections aligned to key areas of my Security First Line Manager apprenticeship at Paddington Square. It evidences how I apply learning in practice and references authoritative UK sources where relevant.

## Area 1: Health & Safety  
**How I assess and control risks in my area of responsibility**

I apply the **HSE five-step risk assessment** model in daily operations and during formal reviews:

1. Identify hazards  
2. Decide who might be harmed and how  
3. Evaluate risks and select controls  
4. Record findings and communicate  
5. Review and update

I use dynamic risk assessments while on patrols (e.g. blocked fire exits, unsafe contractor practices, trip hazards), and I escalate significant issues to management without delay. I brief security officers during handovers and toolbox talks so controls are clear and understood. Where relevant, I reference statutory requirements (e.g. RIDDOR reporting via HSE) and maintain accurate logs to evidence compliance.

## Area 2: Customer & Stakeholders  
**How I identify and meet stakeholder needs**

I map stakeholders (tenants, Knight Frank management, contractors, visitors, my security team) and gather needs through:
- Daily engagement during operations and patrols  
- SLA reviews and site meetings  
- Feedback from incidents, helpdesk tickets, and email correspondence

I tailor responses accordingly—for example, prioritising rapid, safety-critical updates for building management, while delivering reassurance and clear wayfinding for the public. I log actions and outcomes so I can evidence delivery against SLAs.

## Area 4: Staff Management & Development  
**How I manage performance and support development**

I set clear standards (site SOPs, post orders, radio etiquette) and monitor performance by:
- Observing conduct and task completion on shift
- Delivering timely, constructive feedback and 1-to-1s
- Running incident debriefs and capturing lessons learned

For development, I plan **toolbox talks**, encourage **e-learning**, and share insight from my apprenticeship modules (e.g. communication, risk, customer service). I promote mentoring and shadowing to build confidence, capability, and consistency across the team.

---

## Area 5: Contract Performance  
**How I monitor KPIs and take action**

I review KPI data (patrol compliance, response times, incident volumes, customer feedback) against the contract’s SLAs. When a metric trends the wrong way (e.g. missed patrols or repeat false alarms), I:
- Investigate root causes (resource, process, equipment)
- Re-balance deployment and brief the team
- Track results and report improvements to management

I maintain an action log so corrective measures are visible, owned, and time-bound.

## Area 8: Communication  
**Example of adapting communication to different audiences**

- **Team brief/radio**: Clear, concise, task-focused; I request read-backs to confirm understanding.  
- **Knight Frank/management**: Professional and data-informed; I provide short written summaries (what happened, impact, actions, next steps).  
- **Public and visitors**: Calm, reassuring, and service-oriented; I avoid jargon and prioritise safety and accessibility.  
- **Contractors**: Directive but collaborative; I tie instructions to site rules and permit conditions.

I follow the **7 Cs** (Clear, Concise, Concrete, Correct, Coherent, Complete, Courteous) and confirm sensitive details are shared on appropriate channels in line with UK data protection expectations.

## Area 9: CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)  
**How I support sustainability and community initiatives**

I encourage recycling and correct waste segregation, reduce avoidable energy use in security-controlled areas, and support community safety initiatives (e.g. sharing counter-terror awareness messages and vigilance).

- Preventing terrorism (GOV.UK): <https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/protecting-the-uk-against-terrorism>

## Area 11: SFLM Responsibilities  
**How my role impacts others and the wider security environment**

My leadership directly affects team confidence, consistency, and service quality. Externally, I influence tenant satisfaction, contractor compliance, and public reassurance. Professionally, I help demonstrate that security officers deliver risk management, customer service, and stakeholder value—not just enforcement.

---

## Area 12: Resource Management  
**How I plan and deploy people and equipment effectively**

I align deployment to risk and demand (footfall, events, deliveries, contractor works). I ensure radios, CCTV, access systems, and PPE are working and available, and I adjust positions for peaks (e.g. receptions/public realm) versus quieter periods (patrols/training/admin). I record rationales for deployment so decisions are transparent and repeatable.

### Notes on References
All links reference authoritative UK sources where applicable (e.g. HSE, GOV.UK, ICO, NPCC). I periodically review them to keep the knowledge current.
