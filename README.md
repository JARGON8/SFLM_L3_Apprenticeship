## My Apprenticeship Focus

A key theme throughout this portfolio is **privacy and data protection**.  
As a licensed Public Space Surveillance (CCTV) operator and security professional, I place strong emphasis on:  

- Protecting sensitive information and personal data.  
- Applying GDPR principles in day-to-day decision making.  
- Ensuring confidentiality in reports, records, and evidence logs.  
- Using anonymised examples to reflect learning while maintaining professional integrity.  
- Sharing knowledge on privacy through education and public awareness (e.g. my YouTube channel on privacy protection and content removal).  

This privacy-centred approach is not only a compliance requirement but also a demonstration of integrity, professionalism, and customer focus.
