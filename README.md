# Level 3 Apprenticeship – Security First Line Management (ST0330)  

This repository is my **site-neutral portfolio and study hub** for the Level 3 Security First Line Management apprenticeship ([ST0330 standard](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/security-first-line-manager-v1-0)).  
It maps the required areas of the standard to **anonymised, practical evidence**, supported by study notes, templates, and professional reflections.  

- Maintained by **JARGON8**  
- Reference: See **`ST0330_LINK.md`** for the official assessment plan.  
- Assessment methods: **Observation**, **Apprentice Presentation**, **Synoptic Assessment Interview**  

   

## Apprenticeship Focus  

A recurring theme throughout this portfolio is **privacy and data protection**.  
As a licensed [Public Space Surveillance (CCTV) operator](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-an-sia-licence) and frontline security professional, I prioritise:  

- Protecting sensitive information and personal data in line with the [Data Protection Act 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted).  
- Embedding [UK GDPR principles](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/) in daily operations.  
- Maintaining confidentiality in reports, records, and evidence logs.  
- Using anonymised examples to evidence learning and skills.  
- Sharing knowledge through awareness projects (e.g. my YouTube channel on privacy protection and content removal).  

This privacy-centred approach demonstrates not only compliance but also integrity, professionalism, and customer focus.
