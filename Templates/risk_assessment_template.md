# Risk Assessment – Template (Generic)  


**Context:**  
(Describe the area or activity in generic terms – e.g. “Reception area access control” or “Patrol of external perimeter.”)  

**Hazards / Threats:**  
(List possible risks – e.g. unauthorised access, slip/trip hazards, aggressive persons, equipment failure.)  

**Existing Controls:**  
(Outline what measures are already in place – e.g. CCTV, patrol checks, access passes, security presence, H&S signage.)  

**Likelihood (1–5):**  
(1 = Rare, 5 = Almost certain)  

**Impact (1–5):**  
(1 = Minor, 5 = Severe/Critical)  

**Risk Rating (L×I):**  
(Calculate by multiplying Likelihood × Impact. Use a traffic-light system if helpful – e.g. Low, Medium, High.)  

**Additional Controls / Actions:**  
(What further steps could reduce the risk? E.g. refresher training, extra patrols, equipment maintenance, signage improvements.)  

**Owner & Review Date:**  
(Who is responsible for the control and when the risk assessment will next be reviewed.)  








# Risk Assessment – External Patrols



**Context:**  
Routine external patrols of building perimeter and surrounding public realm areas. Conducted by security officers to deter unauthorised access, identify safety hazards, and reassure stakeholders.  

**Hazards / Threats:**  
- Unauthorised persons attempting access to perimeter areas  
- Slips, trips, or falls due to uneven ground or poor lighting  
- Confrontation with aggressive individuals (e.g. trespassers, antisocial behaviour)  
- Lone working risks during quieter periods  
- Adverse weather conditions impacting patrol safety  

**Existing Controls:**  
- Regular patrols scheduled and recorded in log system  
- Two-way radios carried at all times for communication with control room  
- CCTV monitoring of key perimeter points  
- Incident reporting procedures in place  
- PPE (high-visibility jackets, appropriate footwear)  
- Lone worker check-in procedure with control room  

**Likelihood (1–5):**  
3 – Possible (risks occur occasionally during patrols)  

**Impact (1–5):**  
4 – Major (injury, security breach, or serious disruption possible)  

**Risk Rating (L×I):**  
12 – **High Risk**  

**Additional Controls / Actions:**  
- Introduce refresher conflict management training for officers  
- Ensure torches are carried during night patrols  
- Increase frequency of supervisor spot-checks on patrols  
- Review CCTV coverage for blind spots along the perimeter  
- Schedule toolbox talk on dynamic risk assessment during patrols  

**Owner & Review Date:**  
Security Supervisor (review every 6 months or following a significant incident)
