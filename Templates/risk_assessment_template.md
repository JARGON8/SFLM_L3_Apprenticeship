# Risk Assessment – Template (Generic)  


**Context:**  
(Describe the area or activity in generic terms – e.g. “Reception area access control” or “Patrol of external perimeter.”)  

**Hazards / Threats:**  
(List possible risks – e.g. unauthorised access, slip/trip hazards, aggressive persons, equipment failure.)  

**Existing Controls:**  
(Outline what measures are already in place – e.g. CCTV, patrol checks, access passes, security presence, H&S signage.)  

**Likelihood (1–5):**  
(1 = Rare, 5 = Almost certain)  

**Impact (1–5):**  
(1 = Minor, 5 = Severe/Critical)  

**Risk Rating (L×I):**  
(Calculate by multiplying Likelihood × Impact. Use a traffic-light system if helpful – e.g. Low, Medium, High.)  

**Additional Controls / Actions:**  
(What further steps could reduce the risk? E.g. refresher training, extra patrols, equipment maintenance, signage improvements.)  

**Owner & Review Date:**  
(Who is responsible for the control and when the risk assessment will next be reviewed.)
