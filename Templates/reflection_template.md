# Reflection â€“ Template  



**What I did:**  
(Describe the task, activity, or incident you took part in. Keep it anonymised and generic. Focus on your role and responsibilities.)  

**What I learned:**  
(Explain the key learning points. Did you develop new skills, improve knowledge, or reinforce good practice? Highlight links to theory, legislation, or organisational policy.)  

**How this maps to the standard:**  
(Link your reflection to the relevant **ST0330 apprenticeship area** and criteria. State whether it demonstrates knowledge, skills, or behaviours. Show evidence of meeting Pass or Distinction standards where possible.)  

**Next steps:**  
(Outline how you will apply this learning in future. Identify improvements, further training, or actions to embed best practice into daily work.)
