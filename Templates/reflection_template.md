# Reflection â€“ Template  



**What I did:**  
I describe the task, activity, or incident I was involved in. I keep this anonymised and generic, focusing on my role and responsibilities.  

**What I learned:**  
I explain the key learning points. I highlight whether I developed new skills, strengthened existing knowledge, or reinforced good practice. I also link my learning to relevant theory, legislation, or organisational policy.  

**How this maps to the standard:**  
I show how this experience links to the relevant **ST0330 apprenticeship area** and criteria. I explain whether it demonstrates knowledge, skills, or behaviours, and where possible I highlight how it meets Pass or Distinction standards.  

**Next steps:**  
I outline how I will apply this learning in the future. I identify any improvements, further training, or actions I will take to embed best practice into my daily work.
