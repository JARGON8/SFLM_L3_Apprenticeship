# Security Resource Management  
*(Security First Line Manager – JARGON8)*  

## Purpose  
Security Resource Management is about planning, organising, and deploying the people, equipment, and systems required to deliver an effective security service. This includes ensuring adequate coverage, maintaining equipment, and allocating resources efficiently in line with customer needs, organisational objectives, and legal requirements.  

## What assessors look for  
- Awareness of the range of resources under your responsibility (e.g. staff, CCTV, access systems, radios, barriers).  
- Evidence of effective **planning and deployment** of resources to meet operational needs.  
- Knowledge of compliance with relevant legislation and organisational policies (e.g. **Equality Act 2010** for staffing, **Data Protection Act 2018** for CCTV).  
- Examples of adapting resources in response to operational challenges (e.g. staff absence, equipment fault, emergency event).  
- Demonstration of continual review and improvement in how resources are used.  

## Evidence (anonymised)  
Examples of what can be included in the `evidence/` folder:  
- Short write-ups of scenarios (e.g. resource allocation during an emergency).  
- Redacted resource checklists or duty rosters.  
- Photos/diagrams of generic equipment setups (without sensitive site details).  
- Meeting notes showing planning for events or high-risk periods.  
- Training records on resource use (e.g. CCTV operation, access control).  

## Study notes  
Key reference areas for `study_notes.md`:  
- **Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974** – ensuring safe use of equipment and safe staffing levels.  
- **Working Time Regulations 1998** – fair and legal rostering of security officers.  
- **Equality Act 2010** – fair deployment of staff, reasonable adjustments for inclusion.  
- **Data Protection Act 2018 / UK GDPR** – lawful use of surveillance equipment and incident records.  
- **BS 7499:2020** – Code of Practice for static guarding, including deployment and supervision.  
- **Resource Planning Tools:** Duty rosters, checklists, scheduling software.  
- **Contingency Management:** Adjusting resources during incidents or unplanned absences.  

## Reflection  
Keep `reflections.md` updated to capture:  
- How I allocated people and equipment during a specific scenario.  
- What triggered changes to the deployment (e.g. emergency, staff shortage, system fault).  
- What worked well and why.  
- Challenges faced (e.g. balancing resources across competing priorities).  
- What I learned about effective deployment.  
- Next steps for improving resource planning and compliance.
