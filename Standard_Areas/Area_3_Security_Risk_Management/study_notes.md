## Definition  

Security Risk Management is the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling risks to people, property, premises, and operations. It enables Security First Line Managers to reduce vulnerabilities, enhance resilience, and ensure compliance with policies, contracts, and legislation.  

---

## Key Elements  

- **Risk Identification:** Recognising potential threats such as unauthorised access, theft, terrorism, cyber risks, health & safety hazards.  
- **Risk Assessment:** Evaluating likelihood and impact to prioritise risks.  
- **Risk Control:** Implementing measures to eliminate, reduce, or mitigate risks.  
- **Monitoring & Review:** Regularly checking effectiveness of controls and updating assessments.  
- **Escalation:** Reporting significant risks to management and stakeholders.

## Risk Assessment Frameworks  

- **Likelihood × Impact Matrix:**  
  Risk Rating = Likelihood (1–5) × Impact (1–5).  
  - Low: 1–4  
  - Medium: 5–9  
  - High: 10–25  

- **SWOT Analysis:**  
  - Strengths – internal advantages.  
  - Weaknesses – internal vulnerabilities.  
  - Opportunities – external positive factors.  
  - Threats – external risks.  

- **PESTLE Analysis:**  
  - Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental influences on risk.  

- **Five Steps to Risk Assessment (HSE):**  
  1. Identify hazards.  
  2. Decide who might be harmed and how.  
  3. Evaluate risks and decide precautions.  
  4. Record findings and implement them.  
  5. Review and update regularly.

## Example Controls  

- **Physical:** CCTV, access control, barriers, patrols.  
- **Procedural:** Assignment Instructions, incident reporting, escalation processes.  
- **Training:** Conflict management, first aid, counter-terrorism awareness.  
- **Partnerships:** Local police, neighbouring businesses, counter-terror initiatives (e.g. Project Griffin / ACT Awareness).

## Diagrams (for notes)  

- **Risk Matrix:** 5×5 grid showing Likelihood vs Impact.  
- **SWOT Quadrant:** Four-box chart for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats.  
- **PESTLE Wheel:** Six segments representing external influences.  
- **Risk Cycle:** Identify → Assess → Control → Monitor → Review.

## Summary  

Security Risk Management is about **being proactive** – spotting potential issues before they become incidents, and applying structured methods to manage threats. It combines compliance with legislation, use of frameworks, and strong communication with stakeholders.
