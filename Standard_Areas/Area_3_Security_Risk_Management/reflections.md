# Reflections – Area 3: Security Risk Management  

---

**What I did:**  
I conducted a generic risk assessment of the external patrol route as part of my apprenticeship project work. During the assessment, I identified several potential threats, including unauthorised access through poorly lit areas, lone working risks during quieter hours, and the possibility of confrontation with members of the public. I documented the hazards, existing controls, and calculated a risk rating using the Likelihood × Impact method.  

**What I learned:**  
I learned how important it is to use a structured framework when assessing risks, such as SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) or PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental). This helped me to think beyond immediate hazards and consider wider influences, such as seasonal changes in footfall or updates in legislation. I also reinforced my understanding of why risk assessments must be regularly reviewed, not just completed once.  

**How this maps to the standard:**  
This activity links to **ST0330 Area 3: Security Risk Management** because I:  
- Identified risks to people, property, and premises.  
- Applied a recognised process for assessing and rating risks.  
- Produced recommendations for improvement, including increasing lighting checks, carrying torches on night patrols, and refresher training on conflict management.  
- Demonstrated knowledge of escalation by preparing to share findings with both management and relevant stakeholders.  

**Next steps:**  
I will review this risk assessment with my supervisor at the next monthly meeting and update it if there are new incidents or feedback. I also plan to compare my findings with industry guidance from sources such as the **[HSE Managing Risks guidance](https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm)** to ensure my assessments are aligned with best practice.

**What I did:**  
I carried out a generic security risk assessment of the building perimeter and surrounding public realm as part of my portfolio work. I identified hazards such as poor lighting, unauthorised access attempts, lone working risks, and potential confrontations with the public. I recorded the risks using a Likelihood × Impact matrix and documented existing controls such as CCTV coverage, routine patrols, and the lone worker check-in process.  

**What I learned:**  
I learned the importance of applying structured frameworks like the HSE “Five Steps to Risk Assessment” and SWOT analysis. Using these methods gave me a clearer way to prioritise risks and consider both internal vulnerabilities (e.g. staffing levels, patrol frequency) and external threats (e.g. local crime trends, seasonal changes). I also reinforced my understanding of why risk assessments are living documents that must be regularly reviewed and updated.  

**How this maps to the standard:**  
This activity meets **ST0330 Area 3: Security Risk Management** because I:  
- Identified and assessed risks to people, property, and premises.  
- Applied a recognised risk rating process (Likelihood × Impact).  
- Produced improvement recommendations, such as increasing supervisor spot-checks on patrols and issuing torches for night shifts.  
- Demonstrated escalation by preparing findings suitable for discussion with management and service partners.  

**Next steps:**  
I will review this assessment with my supervisor during the next checkpoint meeting and update it based on feedback. I also plan to compare my work with industry guidance from the **[HSE: Risk Assessment](https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm)** and **[SIA Standards](https://www.sia.homeoffice.gov.uk/Pages/standards.aspx)** to ensure my recommendations are aligned with best practice.
