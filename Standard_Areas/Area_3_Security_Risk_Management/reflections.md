# Reflections – Area 3: Security Risk Management  

---

**What I did:**  
I conducted a generic risk assessment of the external patrol route as part of my apprenticeship project work. During the assessment, I identified several potential threats, including unauthorised access through poorly lit areas, lone working risks during quieter hours, and the possibility of confrontation with members of the public. I documented the hazards, existing controls, and calculated a risk rating using the Likelihood × Impact method.  

**What I learned:**  
I learned how important it is to use a structured framework when assessing risks, such as SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) or PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental). This helped me to think beyond immediate hazards and consider wider influences, such as seasonal changes in footfall or updates in legislation. I also reinforced my understanding of why risk assessments must be regularly reviewed, not just completed once.  

**How this maps to the standard:**  
This activity links to **ST0330 Area 3: Security Risk Management** because I:  
- Identified risks to people, property, and premises.  
- Applied a recognised process for assessing and rating risks.  
- Produced recommendations for improvement, including increasing lighting checks, carrying torches on night patrols, and refresher training on conflict management.  
- Demonstrated knowledge of escalation by preparing to share findings with both management and relevant stakeholders.  

**Next steps:**  
I will review this risk assessment with my supervisor at the next monthly meeting and update it if there are new incidents or feedback. I also plan to compare my findings with industry guidance from sources such as the **[HSE Managing Risks guidance](https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm)** to ensure my assessments are aligned with best practice.
