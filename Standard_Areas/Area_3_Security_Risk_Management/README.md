# Security Risk Management  
*(Security First Line Manager – JARGON8)*  

---

## Purpose  

This area covers the process of identifying, assessing, and managing threats to people, property, and premises. It ensures that risks are controlled through proactive planning, structured assessments, and appropriate mitigation. For a Security First Line Manager, it means being able to evaluate vulnerabilities, apply frameworks such as risk matrices or SWOT/PESTLE, and communicate recommendations to stakeholders in a clear and professional way.

## What Assessors Look For  

To achieve the **ST0330 grading criteria** in this area, I need to demonstrate:  

- **Pass level:**  
  - Understanding of organisational structures and escalation routes.  
  - Evidence of conducting a security risk assessment.  
  - Identification of threats to people, property, premises, and continuity.  
  - Recommendations for improvement and clear communication of findings.  

- **Distinction level:**  
  - Use of recognised frameworks (e.g. SWOT, PESTLE, Likelihood × Impact matrix).  
  - Showing how external sources of intelligence (e.g. local police, industry initiatives) support risk assessments.  
  - Evidence of evaluating and justifying recommendations.  
  - Clear demonstration of how risks are communicated to stakeholders at different levels.
