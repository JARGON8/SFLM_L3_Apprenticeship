# Reflections – Area 5: Contract Performance and Management  
*(Security First Line Manager – JARGON8)*  

## What I Did  
During a routine monthly KPI review, I noticed that incident response times were falling below the agreed Service Level Agreement (SLA). The SLA required responses within 3 minutes, but the average had slipped to 4–5 minutes over the past month.  

I investigated by reviewing the incident logs, duty rosters, and officer deployment patterns. I discovered that the shortfall was mainly due to officers being allocated to overlapping duties during peak hours, which reduced immediate availability.  

To resolve this, I adjusted the roster to ensure a dedicated officer was always available to respond to incidents during those high-demand times. I also introduced a quick daily briefing point to remind officers of response priorities.  

At the next contract review meeting, I presented the findings, explained the corrective measures, and shared a follow-up report showing that response times had returned to within SLA over the following two weeks.

## What I Learned  
- **Data analysis is essential**: Reviewing logs and KPIs gave me evidence to pinpoint the issue rather than guessing.  
- **Small adjustments can have a big impact**: Reallocating one officer during peak hours resolved the performance gap without additional costs.  
- **Transparency builds trust**: Sharing the problem, solution, and results with the client reinforced confidence in the security service.  
- **Monitoring must be continuous**: Without regular reviews, performance issues may only be spotted when they have already damaged client satisfaction.

## How This Maps to the Standard  
This activity aligns with **ST0330 Area 5: Contract Performance and Management** by demonstrating:  
- **Monitoring KPIs and SLAs** to assess service delivery.  
- **Identifying underperformance** and applying corrective measures.  
- **Compliance with best practice standards** such as [BS 7499:2020 Code of Practice for Static Guarding](https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/provision-of-static-guarding-security-services-code-of-practice).  
- **Customer focus and professionalism**, key behavioural competencies in the apprenticeship.

## Next Steps  
- Establish a **weekly dashboard review** to spot issues earlier.  
- Introduce **trend analysis reports** to identify patterns over several months.  
- Explore digital **real-time tracking tools** to monitor KPIs live.  
- Provide officers with **refresher training** on SLA requirements to reinforce accountability.
