# Study Notes – Area 2: Customer and Stakeholder Management  
*(Security First Line Manager – JARGON8)*  

## Definition  
Customer and Stakeholder Management is the process of recognising the needs of different groups (tenants, visitors, contractors, clients, and service partners) and delivering security solutions that meet or exceed their expectations. It requires balancing operational requirements with compliance, communication, and relationship-building.

## Core Concepts  
- **Stakeholder Identification:** Internal (staff, management) and external (tenants, contractors, emergency services).  
- **Customer Focus:** Exceed expectations and provide added value where possible.  
- **Relationship Management:** Building trust through clear communication and professional behaviour.  
- **Feedback Loops:** Collecting, recording, and acting on feedback from multiple stakeholders.  
- **Conflict Resolution:** Using negotiation and mediation to address disputes or complaints.  
- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Formalised performance commitments that must be monitored and reported.

## Frameworks & Models  

### Stakeholder Analysis (Power/Interest Grid)  
- **High Power, High Interest:** Manage closely (e.g. clients, building owners).  
- **High Power, Low Interest:** Keep satisfied (e.g. regulators, contractors).  
- **Low Power, High Interest:** Keep informed (e.g. staff, tenants).  
- **Low Power, Low Interest:** Monitor (e.g. casual visitors).  

### RACI Model (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)  
- Clarifies stakeholder roles in decision-making.  
- Example: During an evacuation – Security Officers = Responsible, Security Manager = Accountable, Facilities = Consulted, Tenants = Informed.  

### Customer Journey Mapping  
- Analyses the stakeholder’s experience at every touchpoint (entry, access, assistance, exit).  
- Identifies opportunities to improve service delivery.  

---

## Tools & Practices  
- **Surveys & Feedback Logs:** Capture satisfaction levels and concerns.  
- **Regular Meetings & Briefings:** Structured updates with clients and partners.  
- **Complaint Handling Procedures:** Formal escalation aligned with ACAS best practice.  
- **KPI / SLA Reporting:** Evidence of service delivery against agreed standards.  
- **Communication Plans:** Tailoring updates for different audiences (formal reports for clients, briefings for staff, signage for visitors).  

---

## Diagrams (for notes)  
- **Stakeholder Map:** Circles or quadrants showing influence and interest.  
- **RACI Matrix:** Grid showing roles in decision-making.  
- **Customer Journey Flow:** Entry → Experience → Interaction → Exit → Feedback.

## Summary  
Customer and Stakeholder Management ensures that security operations align with the needs of diverse groups while maintaining compliance and professionalism. By applying models such as the **Power/Interest Grid** and **RACI**, and adhering to legislation like the **Equality Act 2010** and **Data Protection Act 2018**, Security First Line Managers can build strong relationships, resolve conflicts, and deliver a service that stakeholders trust and value.
