# Reflections – Area 2: Customer and Stakeholder Management  
*(Security First Line Manager – JARGON8)*  

## What I Did  
I recently received feedback from a tenant representative about delays in access control during peak hours. To address this, I arranged a meeting with both the tenant and the facilities management team. I listened to their concerns, explained the current process, and gathered information on where bottlenecks were occurring.  

Based on the discussion, I reallocated a security officer to support during peak access times and updated the daily briefing notes so the whole team understood the new requirement. I also provided the tenant with updates on the adjustments made and reassured them that their feedback had been acted upon.

## What I Learned  
- Stakeholders value **transparent communication** and want to see their concerns addressed quickly.  
- Proactive engagement helps to build trust and confidence in the security service.  
- Even small operational changes, such as reassigning staff at key times, can significantly improve customer satisfaction.  
- Documenting and communicating changes to the team prevents misunderstandings and ensures consistency of service delivery.

## How This Maps to the Standard  
This directly aligns with **ST0330 Area 2: Customer and Stakeholder Management**:  
- I recognised and responded to stakeholder needs in a professional manner.  
- I demonstrated problem-solving by reallocating resources without disrupting other security tasks.  
- I built stronger relationships by engaging openly and providing clear updates.  
- This also supports the **core behavioural competencies** of being customer-focused, courteous, and professional.

## Next Steps  
- Introduce a **regular stakeholder feedback log** to track concerns and resolutions.  
- Develop a **monthly summary report** for facilities management to highlight patterns in stakeholder requests.  
- Explore additional training for officers on **customer service and stakeholder engagement**.  
- Continue practising **active listening techniques** to ensure concerns are fully understood before solutions are proposed.
