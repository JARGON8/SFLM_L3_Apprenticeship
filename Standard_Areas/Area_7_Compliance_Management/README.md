# Compliance Management  
*(Security First Line Manager – Jorge Ariel Santiago Gonzalez)*  

---

## Purpose  

In the Security First Line Manager apprenticeship, **Compliance Management** (Area 7) covers how I ensure that security operations are carried out in line with **laws, regulations, industry standards, and organisational policies**.  

This involves:  
- Understanding the **legal and regulatory framework** governing security operations  
- Ensuring compliance with company policies, procedures, and best practice guidance  
- Identifying and addressing areas of **non-compliance** before they escalate into risks  
- Supporting **business continuity** through compliant practices  
- Communicating responsibilities clearly to staff and stakeholders

## What Assessors Look For  

In line with the **ST0330 Assessment Plan**, assessors expect me to demonstrate that I can:  

- **Pass**  
  - Describe the **business continuity plan (BCP)** responsibilities for the security service in my area of responsibility  
  - Give examples of non-compliance with regulations at a local or national level (e.g. licensing, [Data Protection Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents), [Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974](https://www.hse.gov.uk/legislation/hswa.htm), [Equality Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents))  
  - Explain how management processes ensure compliance with organisational policies and describe steps taken when non-compliance occurs  

- **Distinction**  
  - Provide detail of the organisation’s BCP and how security services (and one other service) support it  
  - Identify **best practice** that sets the organisation apart from competitors, and explain how this is embedded into the service  

- **Anonymised, real-world examples** might include:  
  - Correcting gaps in daily logs to ensure compliance with data retention requirements  
  - Reviewing licences and SIA badge validity for all staff  
  - Identifying a data protection breach and ensuring it is reported/escalated correctly  
  - Supporting an audit by providing accurate compliance records

- What triggered it (audit, incident, feedback, legislation update)  
- What worked well and why  
- Any challenges faced and how I overcame them

## ✅ Summary  

Compliance Management ensures that security operations are **legal, safe, and aligned to best practice**. As a Security First Line Manager apprentice, my evidence will show how I identify, monitor, and address compliance issues, while my reflections will demonstrate learning and professional growth towards meeting the **ST0330 standard for Area 7**.
