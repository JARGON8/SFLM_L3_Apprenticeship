# Reflections – Area 7: Compliance Management  
*(Security First Line Manager – Jorge Ariel Santiago Gonzalez)*  

---

## What I did  
During a routine check, I identified that two officers’ SIA licences were close to expiry and had not yet been renewed. I carried out the following actions:  
- Cross-checked licence details against the official [SIA register](https://services.sia.homeoffice.gov.uk/rolh/)  
- Informed the officers concerned and reminded them of the renewal process and deadlines  
- Escalated the issue to my line manager to ensure contingency cover if licences were not renewed in time  
- Updated the rota and briefing logs to confirm that only fully licensed staff were deployed on critical posts  

This ensured that the organisation remained compliant with the **Private Security Industry Act 2001** and avoided risk to service delivery.

## What I learned  
I learned that **compliance checks must be proactive** rather than reactive. By identifying the issue early, I was able to prevent a possible breach of legislation and contract.  

I also learned that compliance management is closely linked to **business continuity**: if staff are not licensed, operations can be disrupted, which may damage customer trust and breach contractual obligations.

## How this maps to the standard  
- **Pass criteria**:  
  - I described and managed a compliance risk (licence expiry).  
  - I showed how organisational processes ensured compliance with the law and service-level agreements.  
  - I linked my actions to regulatory requirements under the **SIA licensing framework**.  

- **Distinction criteria**:  
  - I demonstrated an understanding of how this links to **business continuity planning** by identifying contingency measures (rota changes, escalation).  
  - I reflected on best practice by ensuring compliance monitoring is scheduled regularly and embedded into operational routines.

## Next steps  
- Introduce a **monthly compliance audit checklist** covering licences, training records, and data protection procedures.  
- Recommend that upcoming licence expiries are flagged automatically in the rostering system.  
- Continue to raise compliance awareness in team briefings, ensuring officers understand their personal responsibility to maintain valid licences.  
- Explore opportunities to benchmark compliance monitoring against **ISO 9001 quality management** and **ISO 22301 business continuity standards**.
