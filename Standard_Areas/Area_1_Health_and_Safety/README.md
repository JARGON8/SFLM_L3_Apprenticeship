# Area 1: Health and Safety  
*(Security First Line Manager – JARGON8)*  

## Purpose  
Health and Safety is the foundation of effective security operations. It involves identifying, assessing, and controlling workplace risks to protect staff, customers, and the public. Security First Line Managers must apply relevant legislation, company policies, and industry standards to ensure safe working conditions, compliance, and a proactive safety culture.

- Evidence of balancing security duties with health and safety responsibilities.  
- Knowledge of reporting requirements (accidents, near misses, RIDDOR).  
- Examples of conducting or contributing to risk assessments.  
- Awareness of organisational responsibilities and implications of non-compliance.

## Evidence (Anonymised)  
Examples of suitable evidence for the `evidence/` folder:  
- Risk assessment reports (with sensitive details removed).  
- Accident / near-miss investigation notes.  
- Health and safety training attendance records.  
- Toolbox talk notes and staff safety briefings.

## Study Notes  

### Key Legislation & Guidance  
- [Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/contents) — the primary legislation placing a duty of care on employers and employees.  
- [Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/3242/contents/made) — requires risk assessments, preventive measures, and competent persons.  
- [Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) 2013](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1471/contents/made) — outlines when and how incidents must be reported.  
- [Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/2677/contents/made) — controls exposure to hazardous substances (e.g. cleaning chemicals).  
- [Equality Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents) — ensures health and safety measures do not disadvantage protected groups (e.g. through reasonable adjustments).  
- [Health and Safety Executive (HSE) Guidance](https://www.hse.gov.uk/) — authoritative UK resource on workplace safety.  

### Frameworks & Practices  
- **Five Steps to Risk Assessment (HSE):**  
  1. Identify hazards  
  2. Decide who may be harmed and how  
  3. Evaluate risks and decide on controls  
  4. Record findings and implement  
  5. Review and update  

- **Hierarchy of Control (HSE):** Eliminate → Substitute → Engineering Controls → Administrative Controls → PPE.  

- **Incident Investigation Cycle:** Identify → Record → Investigate → Corrective Action → Review.  

- **Safety Culture:** Encourage reporting, provide regular training, and integrate health and safety into daily operations.  

### Tools & Methods  
- **Risk Assessments & Method Statements (RAMS).**  
- **Toolbox Talks and Safety Briefings.**  
- **Accident / Near-Miss Reporting Forms.**  
- **HSE Checklists (fire safety, manual handling, lone working).**  
- **Audit & Inspection Schedules.**

## Summary  
Health and Safety is a statutory and moral duty that underpins the effectiveness of security operations. Security First Line Managers must ensure that risks are identified and controlled, incidents are reported, and staff are supported to work safely. By embedding a strong safety culture and complying with laws such as the **Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974**, managers protect people, property, and organisational reputation.
