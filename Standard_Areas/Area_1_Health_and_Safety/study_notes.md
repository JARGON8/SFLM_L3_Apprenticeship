# Study Notes – Area 1: Health and Safety  
*(Security First Line Manager – JARGON8)*  

## Definition  
Health and Safety (H&S) is the discipline concerned with protecting the health, safety, and welfare of people at work and others who may be affected by work activities. For Security First Line Managers, it means ensuring staff, visitors, and contractors are safe, hazards are controlled, and legal compliance is maintained.

- [Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) 2013](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1471/contents/made) – outlines mandatory reporting of serious incidents.  
- [Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/2677/contents/made) – managing risks from hazardous substances.

## Core Concepts  
- **Duty of Care:** Employers and employees must take reasonable steps to protect others.  
- **Risk Assessment:** A systematic process to identify hazards, evaluate risks, and implement controls.  
- **Near-Miss Reporting:** Capturing incidents before harm occurs to prevent recurrence.  
- **Safety Culture:** Promoting openness, accountability, and continuous improvement in safety.  
- **Emergency Preparedness:** Fire drills, evacuation planning, first aid provision.

## Frameworks & Models  

### Five Steps to Risk Assessment (HSE)  
1. Identify hazards.  
2. Decide who may be harmed and how.  
3. Evaluate the risks and decide on precautions.  
4. Record findings and implement controls.  
5. Review and update regularly.  

### Hierarchy of Control  
1. **Eliminate** – remove the hazard.  
2. **Substitute** – replace with something less risky.  
3. **Engineering Controls** – isolate people from the hazard.  
4. **Administrative Controls** – change how people work (procedures/training).  
5. **PPE** – last line of defence.  

### Incident Investigation Cycle  
- Report → Investigate → Corrective Action → Review → Feedback.  

---

## Tools & Practices  
- **Risk Assessments and Method Statements (RAMS).**  
- **Toolbox Talks and Safety Briefings.**  
- **Accident/Near-Miss Logs (RIDDOR compliance).**  
- **Inspections and Audits (fire safety, manual handling, PPE).**  
- **Training Records (first aid, fire marshal, manual handling).**

## Summary  
Health and Safety is central to the Security First Line Manager role. It ensures safe working environments, legal compliance, and a culture of accountability. By applying frameworks such as **risk assessments**, the **hierarchy of control**, and **incident reporting**, managers can protect staff, customers, and the public while supporting organisational objectives.
