# Reflections – Area 1: Health and Safety  
*(Security First Line Manager – JARGON8)*  

## What I Did  
During a routine patrol, I identified a potential slip hazard caused by a leaking water pipe near a public access route. The hazard was in a high-footfall area and posed a risk not only to staff but also to members of the public.  

I immediately followed organisational procedure by:  
- Cordoning off the area with signage and barriers.  
- Reporting the incident to the facilities management team.  
- Recording the hazard in the daily occurrence log.  
- Completing a formal risk assessment under the [Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/3242/contents/made).  
- Raising a near-miss entry in line with [RIDDOR 2013](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1471/contents/made), in case anyone had been affected.  

I then briefed the security team at the next handover to ensure everyone was aware of the hazard and the temporary measures in place.

## What I Learned  
- **Immediate control measures are essential** to prevent incidents from escalating. Taking swift action reduced the likelihood of injury.  
- **Accurate reporting and record keeping** ensures accountability and provides a trail for legal and organisational compliance.  
- **Team communication** is critical. Without briefing the incoming team, the hazard could have been missed or misunderstood.  
- The situation reinforced the importance of **preventive inspections**: hazards are often found before incidents occur if patrols are thorough.

## How This Maps to the Standard  
This activity aligns with **ST0330 Area 1: Health and Safety** by demonstrating:  
- **Hazard identification and control** in line with the [Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/contents).  
- **Risk assessment** under the [Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/3242/contents/made).  
- **Incident reporting and escalation** according to RIDDOR 2013 requirements.  
- **Team briefings and communication**, which link to both Health and Safety and Area 8: Communication.  

This also shows awareness of how non-compliance could impact the organisation legally, reputationally, and operationally.

## Next Steps  
- **Introduce weekly hazard spot checks** in addition to routine patrols, with findings logged and tracked.  
- **Develop a refresher training module** for staff on hazard reporting and the correct use of control measures.  
- **Enhance communication practices** by integrating near-miss updates into daily briefings.  
- **Benchmark hazard response procedures** against [HSE best practice guidance](https://www.hse.gov.uk/) to ensure alignment with national standards.

## Summary  
This reflection demonstrates how proactive hazard identification, immediate risk control, and thorough reporting contribute to a safer working environment. It evidences compliance with UK legislation and shows how a Security First Line Manager applies leadership and communication skills to uphold both safety and security.
