# Reflections – Area 11: Security First Line Manager (SFLM) Responsibilities  
*(Security First Line Manager – Jorge Ariel Santiago Gonzalez)*  

---

## What I did  
Following customer feedback that some patrols were not being carried out at the expected frequency, I:  
- Reviewed the patrol logs and compared them with contractual KPIs.  
- Spoke with the team to identify challenges (e.g. time pressures, unclear instructions).  
- Adjusted the patrol rota to ensure coverage and accountability.  
- Introduced a system of random supervisor spot checks.  
- Reported the changes back to the customer during a review meeting, highlighting improvements already observed.

## What I learned  
I learned that my responsibilities as a Security First Line Manager go beyond task allocation. It is about:  
- **Balancing customer expectations with team realities** by identifying barriers and solutions.  
- Using **feedback as a tool for service improvement** rather than viewing it as criticism.  
- Understanding how small adjustments (rota changes, spot checks) can strengthen service reliability and customer confidence.  

I also recognised the importance of **communicating service success** back to stakeholders, as this builds trust and demonstrates accountability.

## How this maps to the standard  
- **Pass criteria**:  
  - I explained my role and showed awareness of its diverse responsibilities (managing people, customer expectations, compliance, record-keeping).  
  - I reviewed service performance (patrol logs) and explained the impact on staff, the customer, and the wider security environment.  
  - I identified and communicated service improvements to the customer.  

- **Distinction criteria**:  
  - I provided **added value** by improving patrol reliability, which benefited:  
    - **Staff** – clearer instructions and fairer workload.  
    - **Customer** – increased confidence in service delivery.  
    - **Organisation** – stronger compliance with contract KPIs.  
  - I demonstrated how using **feedback sources** (customer review meeting, staff input) supported development of the service.  
  - I reflected on how failing to act would have damaged customer trust and industry reputation.

## Next steps  
- Continue using **feedback loops** (team briefings, customer review meetings, audits) to measure performance.  
- Explore digital patrol tracking to provide real-time transparency for stakeholders.  
- Share best practices with other teams to embed consistent performance standards.  
- Focus on further developing my leadership approach to motivate staff and sustain high service delivery.
