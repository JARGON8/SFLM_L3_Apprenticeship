---

## Purpose  

Within the Level 3 Apprenticeship in Security First Line Management, **Area 9 – Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)** requires me to demonstrate how security operations affect the **environment, community, and wider society**.  

For me as a first line security manager, this means:  
- Supporting **sustainability and environmental initiatives** (energy reduction, recycling, waste management)  
- Promoting **equality, diversity, and inclusion** in line with organisational values and UK law  
- Encouraging **ethical and professional behaviour** from staff and contractors  
- Supporting **community safety initiatives** such as counter-terrorism awareness and crime prevention partnerships  
- Acting with **integrity and transparency** to protect people, property, and organisational reputation

  - Explain sustainability in practice and provide **two examples** of supporting organisational approaches to reducing carbon footprint  

- **Distinction**  
  - Provide an example of a **CSR practice I have implemented** in my area of responsibility, explaining how it was carried out and what benefits it brought to staff, customers, and the organisation

## ✅ Summary  

CSR in security management is about ensuring that our work not only protects **people, premises, and property**, but also contributes positively to **sustainability, ethical practice, inclusivity, and community wellbeing**.  

As required by the apprenticeship, my evidence will demonstrate anonymised examples of CSR in practice, while my reflections will show professional growth and alignment with the **ST0330 Security First Line Manager Standard (Area 9)**.
