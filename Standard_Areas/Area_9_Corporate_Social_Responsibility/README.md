# Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)  

---

## Purpose  

In my apprenticeship, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) covers how security operations and leadership contribute positively to **ethical standards, environmental sustainability, social wellbeing, and community engagement**.  

As a frontline manager, I see CSR as:  
- Promoting **sustainable practices** (energy efficiency, recycling, reduced waste)  
- Ensuring **equality, accessibility, and inclusion** for all users of the site  
- Encouraging **ethical behaviour** in staff, contractors, and visitors  
- Supporting **community and public safety initiatives**  
- Acting with **integrity, transparency, and professionalism**

  - Demonstrate how security operations affect the environment, community, and stakeholders  
  - Take actions within my remit to support CSR

- Diagrams or photos showing generic setups (e.g. recycling stations)  
- Meeting notes, toolbox talks, training logs centered on CSR themes

## Reflection  

Use `reflections.md` to record:  
- What CSR activity I led or helped with

- What went well and why  
- Challenges encountered and how I addressed them

## ✅ Summary  

CSR in security is about more than guarding—it’s about doing so in a way that **respects people, communities, and the environment**. My evidence and reflections should show that I actively contribute to sustainability, fairness, ethical practices, and community engagement in my role as a frontline security manager.
