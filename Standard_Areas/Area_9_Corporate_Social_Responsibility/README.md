# Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)  

---

## Purpose  

In the Security First Line Manager apprenticeship, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to how organisations – and their security teams – contribute positively to **society, the environment, and the local community**, while maintaining high standards of professionalism and ethics.  

For me as a frontline leader, this means:  
- Supporting **sustainability initiatives** (energy saving, recycling, reducing waste)  
- Promoting **inclusivity, equality, and accessibility** for all building users  
- Encouraging **responsible behaviours** among staff, contractors, and visitors  
- Supporting **community safety initiatives** (e.g. counter-terror awareness, public reassurance)  
- Acting with **integrity and professionalism** in line with company values

## Evidence (Anonymised)  

Evidence should be stored in the `evidence/` folder and kept site-neutral.  

**Typical items include:**  
- Short write-ups of CSR-related activities (e.g. waste management initiatives, diversity workshops)  
- Redacted reports/checklists (e.g. sustainability compliance checks)  
- Photos/diagrams that illustrate processes but show no sensitive details  
- Meeting notes, toolbox talks, or training session records on CSR themes  
- Participation in community engagement programmes

- ISO standards relevant to sustainability and quality (ISO 9001, ISO 14001)

## Reflection  

Use `reflections.md` to record:

- What triggered the activity (policy, legislation, organisational values, or community need)  
- What worked well and why  
- Challenges faced and how I addressed them

- Next steps to embed CSR principles into daily practice

## ✅ Summary  

CSR in security is about ensuring our operations not only protect people and assets, but also **support sustainability, inclusivity, ethical practice, and community wellbeing**. Evidence should demonstrate how I contribute to CSR initiatives, while reflections should show my awareness of the wider impact of security on society and the environment.
