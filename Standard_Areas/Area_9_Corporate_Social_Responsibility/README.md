# Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)  
*(Security First Line Manager – Jorge Ariel Santiago Gonzalez)*  

---

## Purpose  

In the Security First Line Manager apprenticeship, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to how organisations – and their security teams – contribute positively to **society, the environment, and the local community**, while maintaining high standards of professionalism and ethics.  

For me as a frontline leader, this means:  
- Supporting sustainability initiatives (energy saving, recycling, reducing waste)  
- Promoting inclusivity, equality, and accessibility for all building users  
- Encouraging responsible behaviours among staff, contractors, and visitors  
- Supporting community safety initiatives (e.g. counter-terror awareness, public reassurance)  
- Acting with integrity and professionalism in line with company values

## What Assessors Look For  

Assessors will expect me to:  

- **Align with ST0330 grading criteria (Pass/Distinction)** by demonstrating I can:  
  - Understand the role of CSR in the security sector  
  - Show awareness of how security operations affect communities, staff, and the environment  
  - Actively support and promote CSR initiatives within my role  
  - Reflect on the wider impact of ethical and sustainable practice  

- **Provide anonymised, real-world examples**, such as:  
  - Encouraging recycling or correct waste disposal in a workplace setting  
  - Supporting accessibility for visitors with additional needs  
  - Participating in community safety campaigns (e.g. counter-terror awareness, safeguarding initiatives)  
  - Promoting diversity and inclusion through fair staff management  
  - Contributing to health and wellbeing activities (e.g. promoting safe working practices, mental health awareness)  

- **Link to frameworks and regulations (generic):**  
  - Health & Safety at Work Act 1974  
  - Equality Act 2010  
  - UK GDPR (responsible handling of data)  
  - Modern Slavery Act 2015 (supply chain responsibility)

## Evidence (Anonymised)  

Evidence should be stored in the `evidence/` folder and kept site-neutral.  

**Typical items include:**  
- Short write-ups of CSR-related activities (e.g. waste management initiatives, diversity workshops)  
- Redacted reports/checklists (e.g. sustainability compliance checks)  
- Photos/diagrams that illustrate processes but show no sensitive details  
- Meeting notes, toolbox talks, or training session records on CSR themes  
- Participation in community engagement programmes

## Study Notes  

Use `study_notes.md` to capture:  
- Key CSR definitions and principles  
- ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) frameworks  
- ISO standards relevant to sustainability and quality  
- Examples of CSR in the security industry (e.g. Project Servator, Prevent strategy awareness, inclusive recruitment)  
- Notes from webinars, toolbox talks, or mentoring sessions about sustainability and ethics

## Reflection  

Use `reflections.md` to record:  
- What CSR activities I supported or led  
- What triggered the activity (policy, legislation, organisational values, or community need)  
- What worked well and why  
- Challenges faced and how I addressed them  
- What I learned about the importance of CSR in security  
- How this maps to the ST0330 criteria for CSR  
- Next steps to embed CSR principles into daily practice

## ✅ Summary  

CSR in security is about ensuring our operations not only protect people and assets, but also **support sustainability, inclusivity, ethical practice, and community wellbeing**. Evidence should demonstrate how I contribute to CSR initiatives, while reflections should show my awareness of the wider impact of security on society and the environment.
