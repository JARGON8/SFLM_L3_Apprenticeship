# Reflections – Area 9: Corporate Social Responsibility  



## What I did  
I identified that some visitors were experiencing difficulties accessing part of the site due to unclear signage and a lack of clear guidance for wheelchair users. To support accessibility, I worked with the team to:  
- Check existing routes for compliance with accessibility requirements  
- Provide clear verbal directions and escort where necessary  
- Suggest improvements to signage and lighting in certain areas  
- Include accessibility reminders in daily team briefings  

This ensured visitors with additional needs felt supported and able to access the premises with dignity and ease.

## What I learned  
I learned that **CSR is not just about environmental sustainability** but also about **inclusion and equality**. Making small adjustments such as improved communication and signposting can have a major impact on a visitor’s experience.  

I also learned the importance of proactively raising issues: by suggesting simple signage improvements, I supported both visitor wellbeing and the organisation’s CSR commitments.

## How this maps to the standard  
- **Pass**:  
  - I demonstrated CSR in practice by promoting accessibility (a social responsibility).  
  - I identified good practice (supporting visitors with clear guidance) and poor practice (lack of clear signage).  
  - I showed how this links to legislation such as the [Equality Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents).  
  - I connected it to wider CSR goals of inclusion and fairness.  

- **Distinction**:  
  - I **implemented a CSR-related practice** by briefing the team, raising the issue to management, and suggesting improvements.  
  - I explained how this benefits:  
    - **Staff** – by giving them clear instructions on how to assist visitors  
    - **Customers/Visitors** – by improving confidence and accessibility  
    - **The organisation** – by demonstrating compliance and inclusivity, strengthening reputation and trust

## Next steps  
I plan to:  
- Continue raising awareness in briefings about accessibility needs.  
- Work with the facilities team to ensure signage and lighting improvements are followed through.  
- Monitor visitor feedback to check whether the changes have improved the experience for those with additional needs.  
- Explore opportunities for further CSR contributions, such as supporting community awareness initiatives (e.g. [Project Servator](https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/servator/)) and environmental sustainability measures.
