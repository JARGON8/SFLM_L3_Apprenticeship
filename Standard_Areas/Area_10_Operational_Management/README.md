# Operational Management  
*(Security First Line Manager – Jorge Ariel Santiago Gonzalez)*  

---

## Purpose  

Operational management in the Security First Line Manager apprenticeship is about how I **plan, coordinate, and oversee daily security operations** to ensure they run safely, efficiently, and in compliance with organisational and legal requirements.  

It covers:  
- Deployment of people and resources  
- Monitoring service delivery against KPIs and SLAs  
- Applying risk management principles  
- Coordinating with stakeholders and service partners  
- Ensuring compliance with legislation, standards, and internal policies  

This area demonstrates how I turn policies and procedures into **practical, day-to-day actions** that keep operations secure and professional.

## What Assessors Look For  

When observing or reviewing my evidence, assessors expect me to:  

- **Meet ST0330 grading criteria (Pass/Distinction)** for Operational Management by showing I can:  
  - Plan and prioritise operational tasks  
  - Monitor and evaluate service performance  
  - Apply problem-solving to operational challenges  
  - Lead staff in delivering consistent and compliant services  
  - Adapt operations to changing risks and requirements  

- **Give anonymised, real-world examples** of operational management in practice, such as:  
  - Adjusting patrols due to an identified risk  
  - Planning staffing resources for a high-footfall event  
  - Coordinating with contractors or service partners during maintenance  
  - Responding to an operational incident and reviewing the outcome  

- **Link to relevant frameworks** (generic, site-neutral):  
  - Health & Safety at Work Act 1974  
  - GDPR and data protection principles  
  - Equality Act 2010  
  - SIA licence obligations  
  - BS 7499:2020 (Code of Practice for Security Guarding and Static Site Services)  
  - Company SOPs, risk assessments, and escalation procedures

## Evidence (Anonymised)  

All evidence should be stored in the `evidence/` folder and redacted where necessary.  

**Typical evidence includes:**  
- Short write-ups of operational scenarios (e.g. resource planning, incident response)  
- Redacted reports, checklists, or rota plans  
- Photos/diagrams that reveal processes without sensitive detail  
- Minutes or notes from operational meetings  
- Training or toolbox talk records showing planning and delivery

## Study Notes  

Use `study_notes.md` to capture:  
- Key theories and models (e.g. risk assessment cycles, PDCA cycle, resource management frameworks)  
- Industry guidance (BS standards, SIA requirements)  
- Notes from courses, toolbox talks, or mentoring sessions  
- Useful reference links (HSE, ICO, NPCC, GOV.UK, CPNI/NPSA)  

---

## Reflection  

Use `reflections.md` to record:  
- What operational management tasks I completed  
- What worked well and why  
- What challenges I faced and how I overcame them  
- What I learned and how it maps to the ST0330 standard  
- Next steps for improving operational management skills

## ✅ Summary  

Operational management is about ensuring that **day-to-day security services are delivered consistently, safely, and in compliance with regulations and standards**. Evidence should demonstrate **planning, monitoring, resource allocation, and leadership**, while reflections should show **learning and professional growth** in this area.
