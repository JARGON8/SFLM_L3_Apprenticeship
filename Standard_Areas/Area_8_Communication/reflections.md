# Reflections – Area 8: Communication  
*(Security First Line Manager – JARGON8)*  

## What I Did  
During a shift, I had to brief my security team about an upcoming high-profile visitor. I delivered a detailed pre-shift briefing covering patrol adjustments, access control changes, and incident response priorities. I used clear, structured verbal communication supported by written briefing notes to ensure consistency.  

Later in the day, I dealt with a visitor complaint regarding building access. I adapted my communication by using a calm and courteous tone, actively listening to their concerns, and then explaining the access policy in plain terms. I reassured the visitor, apologised for the inconvenience, and escalated the issue appropriately.  

At the end of my shift, I completed a debrief and logged the incident in the occurrence book, ensuring the details were clear and factual for the next team.

## What I Learned  
- Different audiences require different communication approaches: **concise and directive** with the team, **calm and empathetic** with visitors, and **factual and precise** in written logs.  
- Using both **verbal and written formats** ensured that critical information was not lost.  
- Active listening helped de-escalate conflict and maintain a professional relationship with the visitor.  
- Accurate records are essential for continuity, accountability, and compliance.

## How This Maps to the Standard  
This reflection links directly to **ST0330 Area 8: Communication** by demonstrating:  
- **Use of appropriate communication methods** (briefings, incident response, and logs).  
- **Adaptability** in communication styles for different audiences (team, visitor, stakeholders).  
- **Professionalism and courtesy** in handling conflict.  
- **Compliance** with the [Data Protection Act 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted) and organisational reporting standards.  

It also evidences **core behavioural competencies** such as being professional, courteous, calm, and customer-focused.

## Next Steps  
- Practise delivering **short, focused briefings** using the “SMEAC” format (Situation, Mission, Execution, Administration, Communication).  
- Develop more **scenario-based role-play** with my team to practise conflict communication techniques.  
- Improve written reports by reviewing best practice guidance in [BS 7499:2020 Code of Practice for Static Guarding](https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/provision-of-static-guarding-security-services-code-of-practice).  
- Continue to seek **feedback from colleagues and managers** on clarity and effectiveness of my communication.
