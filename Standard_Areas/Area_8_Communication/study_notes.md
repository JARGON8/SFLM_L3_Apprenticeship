Study Notes – Area 8: Communication
(Apprenticeship Reflection – Jorge Ariel Santiago Gonzalez)
1. What Communication Means to Me
As part of my apprenticeship, I have learned that communication is the exchange of ideas, knowledge, or instructions between people. In security, this can be verbal, written, nonverbal, or digital. I now see that effective communication is not just about passing information, but ensuring it is understood correctly, acted upon, and free from unnecessary misunderstanding.

Key concepts I use daily:
Sender / Encoder – the person giving information (me briefing my team).
Receiver / Decoder – the person receiving it (e.g. control room officer).
Channel / Medium – the method used (radio, face-to-face, email).
Noise – barriers such as background noise, radio interference, or stress.
Feedback – confirmation that the message has been understood.
2. Models of Communication I Apply
During my apprenticeship, I have studied different models of communication and related them to real workplace scenarios at Paddington Square:
Shannon & Weaver’s Model
Helps me think about interference (noise) on the radios and how I can reduce errors.
Lasswell’s Model
Reminds me to consider outcomes — e.g. “Who says what, to whom, through which channel, and with what effect?” Useful when giving clear evacuation instructions.
Schramm’s Interactive Model
Shows me that shared knowledge (“field of experience”) matters. For example, when briefing agency staff, I adapt language because they may not know site-specific jargon.
Transactional Model
Highlights that communication is constant and two-way. In a live incident, I am both giving and receiving information simultaneously.

3. Principles of Effective Communication I Follow
Through training and practice, I have applied the following principles:
Clarity and Simplicity – I avoid jargon when briefing contractors or visitors.
Conciseness – In emergencies, I keep radio messages short but accurate.
Feedback – I ask officers to repeat back instructions to confirm understanding.
Active Listening – I focus fully when a tenant or colleague raises a concern.
Appropriate Medium – I use email for formal incident reports, but radio for urgent updates.
Confidentiality – I ensure sensitive information is only shared with those who need to know.
Calmness – Especially in stressful situations, my tone influences others.
4. Communication in My Security Role
In my day-to-day work at Paddington Square, I use communication in several key ways:
Shift Handover Briefings – I follow a structured method to ensure critical risks, incidents, or updates are passed on clearly.
Incident Reporting – I write detailed, factual reports that could be used in investigations or legal matters.
Emergency Communication – I use radios and PEEPs (Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans) instructions to guide occupants safely.
Customer Service – I communicate politely with tenants and visitors, ensuring a professional image of CIS Security Limited.
Liaison with Stakeholders – I adapt communication styles depending on whether I am dealing with Knight Frank management, contractors, or members of the public.
5. Frameworks That Support My Learning
I now apply specific frameworks in my role:
Sender–Message–Channel–Receiver–Feedback–Noise
A checklist I use to plan or reflect on communications.

SWOT on Communication
Strengths: calm tone, professionalism
Weaknesses: sometimes too detailed under time pressure
Opportunities: further training in conflict communication
Threats: misunderstandings in emergencies
6. How This Has Developed Me
This area of the apprenticeship has improved how I lead and support my team. I am now more aware of barriers to communication and how to overcome them. I have practised role plays, toolbox talks, and incident simulations where communication was critical to success.
I also recognise that in corporate security, poor communication can cause risk escalation, while effective communication can prevent incidents, protect people, and enhance service quality.
