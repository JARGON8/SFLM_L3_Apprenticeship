# Study Notes – Area 8: Communication  
*(Security First Line Manager – JARGON8)*  

## Definition  
Communication in security management refers to the accurate, professional, and secure exchange of information between colleagues, customers, stakeholders, and external partners (e.g. emergency services). It includes verbal, non-verbal, and written methods, ensuring that information is delivered clearly, adapted to the audience, and compliant with legislation and organisational standards.  

    

## Key UK Legislation & Guidance  
- [Data Protection Act 2018 (UK GDPR)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted) – ensures confidentiality and secure handling of personal or sensitive information.  
- [Equality Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents) – requires fair, respectful, and inclusive communication, including reasonable adjustments.  
- [Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/contents) – underpins the duty to communicate risks and safe working practices effectively.  
- [ACAS – Improving Communication in the Workplace](https://www.acas.org.uk/improving-communication-in-the-workplace) – practical workplace communication guidance.  
- [BS 7499:2020 Code of Practice for Static Guarding](https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/provision-of-static-guarding-security-services-code-of-practice) – outlines professional standards for reporting, briefings, and communication in security operations.  

    

## Core Concepts  

- **Verbal Communication**  
  - Used in briefings, debriefings, incident responses, and stakeholder updates.  
  - Requires clarity, tone control, and professional language.  

- **Non-Verbal Communication**  
  - Includes body language, facial expressions, and posture.  
  - Critical for de-escalation during conflict situations.  

- **Written Communication**  
  - Logs, reports, emails, assignment instructions, and policies.  
  - Must be clear, factual, and compliant with data protection laws.  

- **Active Listening**  
  - Listening carefully, confirming understanding, and responding appropriately.  
  - Builds trust with colleagues and stakeholders.  

- **Conflict Management**  
  - Remaining calm, respectful, and professional.  
  - Applying structured frameworks like **DESC** to de-escalate issues.  

- **Confidentiality**  
  - Communicating only on a need-to-know basis.  
  - Ensuring sensitive data is protected under policy and legislation.  

    

## Frameworks & Models  

### 1. Shannon-Weaver Model of Communication  
- **Sender → Message → Channel → Receiver → Feedback**  
- Highlights potential barriers (noise) such as poor radio signals, unclear instructions, or misunderstandings.  

### 2. Transactional Model  
- Emphasises two-way, interactive communication.  
- Recognises the influence of **context** (cultural, organisational, situational).  

### 3. DESC Model (Conflict Resolution)  
- **Describe** the situation.  
- **Express** your feelings.  
- **Specify** what you want.  
- **Consequences** if agreement is not reached.  
- Example: “I understand you’re upset (Describe). I feel concerned about staff safety (Express). Please step back from the restricted area (Specify). If not, I will have to escalate the incident (Consequences).”  

### 4. SMEAC Briefing Model (used in security and emergency services)  
- **Situation:** What is happening?  
- **Mission:** What needs to be achieved?  
- **Execution:** How will tasks be carried out?  
- **Administration:** Resources, timings, logistics.  
- **Communication:** Channels, escalation routes, reporting lines.  

    

## Tools & Practices  

- **Briefings & Debriefings:**  
  - Daily communication to ensure alignment on tasks, risks, and updates.  
  - Should follow structured models (e.g. SMEAC).  

- **Incident Logs & Reports:**  
  - Accurate, factual, and timely.  
  - Critical for investigations, audits, and compliance.  

- **Radios & Digital Communication Tools:**  
  - Require clear, concise “radio discipline.”  
  - Example: “Control, this is Patrol 1, commencing floor sweep, over.”  

- **Handovers:**  
  - Essential for shift continuity.  
  - Should cover incidents, changes, and outstanding tasks.  

- **Stakeholder Updates:**  
  - Regular reports or meetings to maintain confidence.  
  - Must balance detail with professionalism.  

- **Role-Play Scenarios & Training:**  
  - Practise conflict communication, evacuation announcements, or customer interactions.

## Summary  
Communication underpins all aspects of the Security First Line Manager role. From briefings and logs to conflict resolution and stakeholder management, effective communication ensures safety, compliance, and professionalism. By applying frameworks such as **Shannon-Weaver**, **DESC**, and **SMEAC**, and by complying with legislation like the **Data Protection Act 2018** and **Equality Act 2010**, managers can adapt their style to different audiences while protecting people, property, and organisational reputation.
