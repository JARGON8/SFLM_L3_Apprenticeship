## Reflection (linked to evidence)  
- **What I did:** Delivered a structured briefing and monitored real-time communication via radio.  
- **What I learned:** Using SMEAC for briefings and standard radio discipline keeps the team aligned and ensures rapid response.  
- **How this maps to the standard:** Demonstrates verbal (briefing, radio), non-verbal (command presence), and written communication (logs), aligned with ST0330 Area 8 criteria.  
- **Next steps:** Continue to practise structured handovers and ensure radio calls remain concise and professional under pressure.
