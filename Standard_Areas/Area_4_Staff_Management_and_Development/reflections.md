# Reflections – Area 4: Staff Management and Development  

---

**What I did:**  
I carried out an anonymised one-to-one review with a team member as part of my responsibilities for staff performance management. I discussed their recent shift performance, listened to their feedback about patrol challenges, and reviewed their training record to identify any gaps. I used the organisation’s standard appraisal form to keep the process structured and fair.  

**What I learned:**  
I learned that different staff respond better to tailored communication styles – this individual valued clear recognition of their strengths before discussing areas for improvement. I also saw the importance of linking feedback to specific observations rather than general impressions. This reinforced my understanding of feedback models such as SBI (Situation, Behaviour, Impact).  

**How this maps to the standard:**  
This reflection links to **ST0330 Area 4: Staff Management and Development**. It shows I can:  
- Monitor performance using fair and transparent methods.  
- Apply communication techniques effectively in a staff development context.  
- Support growth through structured feedback and planning.  
- Demonstrate awareness of employment law and organisational policies in people management.  

**Next steps:**  
I plan to carry out follow-up one-to-ones quarterly to track progress and maintain motivation. I will also encourage staff to suggest their own development goals so that appraisals are more collaborative. To strengthen my skills further, I will continue to practise coaching techniques such as the GROW model during team development sessions.
