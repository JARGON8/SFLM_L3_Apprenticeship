## Guidance
- Keep all examples **generic and anonymised** — no client names, locations, or sensitive details.  
- Reflect on **what you did**, **what impact it had**, and **how it links to the Annex criteria**.  
- Use consistent formatting so examples can be cross-referenced during assessment.  
- Update this folder regularly — even small everyday examples build strong evidence.
