# Core Behavioural Competencies (per ST0330 Assessment Plan)  

---

## Purpose  

This folder records **anonymised examples** of how I demonstrate the professional behaviours required in the apprenticeship standard. It acts as a **working log** from daily duties, training exercises, and observations.  

Each entry shows:  
- **What I did** (behaviour in action)  
- **The outcome** (impact/result)  
- **Reflection** (learning and link to Annex criteria)  

All examples are **generic and site-neutral** — no client names, specific locations, or sensitive details are included.

## Behavioural Competencies  

### 1. Security Conscious  
- **Definition:** I work in a way that protects people, property, and premises.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Date/Context:** Routine patrol during evening shift.  
  - **Action Taken:** I noticed a fire exit door left ajar. I secured the door, logged the incident, and reminded the cleaning contractor of the fire safety and security policy.  
  - **Outcome:** Premises remained secure, and a potential unauthorised access risk was prevented.  
  - **Reflection:** I reinforced my awareness of how small oversights can create vulnerabilities. This links to Annex criteria on protecting property and people.

### 2. Professional  
- **Definition:** I maintain conduct that meets organisational standards at all times.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Date/Context:** Customer meeting with site management.  
  - **Action Taken:** I presented updates clearly, used professional language, and wore the correct uniform.  
  - **Outcome:** The customer was reassured by the team’s professional image and communication.  
  - **Reflection:** I learned that professionalism builds trust and credibility. This supports Annex requirements for maintaining organisational standards.

### 3. Courteous & Respectful  
- **Definition:** I remain polite, respectful, and considerate, even in difficult situations.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Date/Context:** Dealing with a frustrated delivery driver at the service entrance.  
  - **Action Taken:** I listened calmly, explained the access policy, and provided directions to resolve the issue.  
  - **Outcome:** The driver complied, and the situation was defused without escalation.  
  - **Reflection:** Respectful communication maintains positive relations and prevents conflict. This links to Annex expectations on professional courtesy.

### 4. Calm  
- **Definition:** I keep my composure under pressure and use conflict management techniques to defuse situations.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Date/Context:** Confrontation between two visitors in the reception area.  
  - **Action Taken:** I used a calm tone, positioned myself safely, and applied de-escalation techniques until support arrived.  
  - **Outcome:** The incident was resolved without physical intervention.  
  - **Reflection:** Staying calm prevents escalation and reassures others. This aligns with Annex conflict management requirements.

### 5. Customer Focused  
- **Definition:** I look for ways to exceed expectations and add value in my role.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Date/Context:** Regular tenant feedback highlighted confusion about visitor pass procedures.  
  - **Action Taken:** I created a simplified quick-reference guide and shared it with reception staff and visitors.  
  - **Outcome:** Reduced waiting times and improved customer satisfaction.  
  - **Reflection:** Proactively solving customer problems adds value and supports Annex expectations of exceeding customer needs.  

---

### 6. Confidential  
- **Definition:** I protect sensitive information and comply with policy and legislation at all times.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Date/Context:** Contractor asked for access to restricted documents.  
  - **Action Taken:** I explained that I could not share the information without authorisation and redirected the request to the appropriate manager.  
  - **Outcome:** Sensitive information was protected in line with GDPR and company policy.  
  - **Reflection:** Upholding confidentiality protects the organisation and customer trust. This demonstrates compliance with Annex requirements on information security.  

---

### 7. Integrity  
- **Definition:** I work with honesty and high standards, making decisions that serve the greater good rather than personal benefit.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Date/Context:** Staffing shortfall during an evening shift.  
  - **Action Taken:** I volunteered to extend my shift to ensure operational coverage, even though it was inconvenient personally.  
  - **Outcome:** The site remained fully covered, and the customer experienced no service disruption.  
  - **Reflection:** Acting with integrity means prioritising the service and organisation above personal preference. This links directly to Annex integrity criteria.

## Guidance  

- Keep all examples **anonymised and generic**.  
- Focus on **action → outcome → reflection**.  
- Regularly update with fresh examples, as everyday actions provide strong evidence.  
- Ensure each competency example is **cross-referenced to Annex criteria** for easy mapping during assessment.
