# Core Behavioural Competencies (per assessment plan)

This folder is where I record anonymised examples of how I demonstrate the professional behaviours required in the apprenticeship standard. I use this as a working log during day-to-day work, training exercises, and observations. Each example is linked to the Annex criteria in the ST0330 assessment plan.

## Guidance

- I keep all examples **generic and anonymised** â€” no client names, no specific locations, no sensitive details.  
- I focus on **what I did**, the **impact of my actions**, and how each example links to the **Annex criteria**.  
- I use consistent formatting so that evidence can be easily cross-referenced during assessment.  
- I update this folder regularly, as even everyday actions can provide strong evidence of my behaviours.
